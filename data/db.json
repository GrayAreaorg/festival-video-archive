The applications of electronic wave forms in music, media, communications, and computing inspired artists to draw on a century’s worth of modernist and conceptual traditions in graphic art. The animation of typographic art as a tool to communicate technological specifics and program developments in the computing fields of the 1950s is detailed as a particular example of an artistic tradition extended beyond its original context when combined with a technological purpose.\n\nThe Gray Area Festival is four days of conference, performances, workshops, and exhibitions to discuss the impact of art and technology on culture.

One of the ongoing research topics is the creation and manipulation of emergent systems and the possibilities for composition that arise from them. The artists aim to create their own abstract language that is mostly based on rule-sets within self-built systems. Macular aims for a minimalistic aesthetic through a continuous exploration of the basic characteristic properties of the media they use. Whether they are cultivated systems or natural phenomena, the medium gets stripped down to the essence of the medium itself. Moderated by Sophie Lamparter.\n\nThe Gray Area Festival is four days of conference, performances, workshops, and exhibitions to discuss the impact of art and technology on culture.

Phillips has work appearing in the book “Keywords for Radicals: The Contested Vocabulary of Late Capitalist Struggle” and has had work published in the Temple University Political and Civil Rights Journal, Atlanta Black Star, and other publications.\n\nMoor Mother or Moor Mother Goddess is an experimental music project by Camae Defstar, a musician and poet from the United States.\n\nHer work has been labelled “hardcore poetry,” “power electronics,” “slaveship punk,” and “protest music.” Ayewa herself resists categorization, preferring to self-identify through terms such as “time traveller” and “truth teller.” A self-described Afrofuturist, she uses spacetime-bending sound and lyricism to reformulate concepts of memory, history, and the future in an afrocentric or afrodiasporic tradition.\n\nAyewa is one half of the Black Quantum Futurism collective, along with Rasheedah Phillips of the Afrofuturist Affair. She has performed in the punk band The Mighty Paradocs, and is also the co-founder of Rockers! Philly, an “event series and festival focused on marginalized artists”. In June 2016, Ayewa and Phillips opened the Community Futures Lab, an “afrofuturist community center” in North Philadelphia where they lead workshops and teach-ins, provide space for artistic practice, and fight gentrification in the area.\n\nHer debut album Fetish Bones was named one of the top experimental albums of the year by Rolling Stone, and Pitchfork as well as one of the best albums of the year by The Wire. The album is available on her Bandcamp page, along with several EPs, experiments, and collaborations from earlier in her career.\n\nGray Area\nhttp://grayarea.org/\nhttp://www.meetup.com/GrayArea/\nhttps://twitter.com/GrayAreaorg","channel_id":"UCW12UmkdiMFyiC0BO15YRfA","channel_url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW12UmkdiMFyiC0BO15YRfA","duration":2226,"webpage_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko8QCaGHXVY","tags":["+Gray","Area","Foundation","for","the","arts","Organization","+Art","+Tech","and","Technology","Theater"],"upload_date":"20180218","playlist":"2017 Gray Area Festival","playlist_id":"PLm8zJ0HKEJIYAk9rAz1CQmE9Pzn8G_hrq","playlist_title":"2017 Gray Area Festival","display_id":"Ko8QCaGHXVY","fulltitle":"Black Quantum Futurism | Moor Mother + Rasheedah Phillips |  the Gray Area Festival 2017","duration_string":"37:06","width":1920,"height":1080,"fps":30,"aspect_ratio":1.78,"audio_channels":2,"festival_year":"2017","thumbnail_small":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ko8QCaGHXVY/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCMQBEG5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBPTZpghmTOUasynYYokaftfGAumQ","subtitlesFile":"./data/videos/2017/Black Quantum Futurism ｜ Moor Mother + Rasheedah Phillips ｜  the Gray Area Festival 2017 [Ko8QCaGHXVY].en.vtt"},{"id":"kvefuhhweSk","title":"Caroline Sinders | the Gray Area Festival 2017","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/kvefuhhweSk/maxresdefault.webp","description":"Event\nhttp://grayareafestival.io\n\nSpeaker: \nhttp://carolinesinders.com/\n\nCaroline Sinders is an artist, researcher and designer with a speciality in machine learning and conversation and an Open Lab Fellow with BuzzFeed and Eyebeam.

The threads of his early education grounded his interest in physical structures: geometry, patterns, and minimalist forms. As Lemercier’s work evolved, he began to play with these concrete structures through the physics and philosophy of how light can be used to manipulate perceived reality.\n\nSince 2006 Lemercier has worked with projected light, and he co founded visual label AntiVJ in 2008, with artists Yannick Jacquet, Romain Tardy and Olivier Ratsi. He worked on stage design for festivals such as Mutek (Montreal, Mexico) and worked alongside artists such as Flying Lotus (special show at the Roundhouse London), and with Portishead’s Adrian Utley (as part of the cultural Olympiads, London 2012), and architectural projections all around the world.\n\nIn 2010, Lemercier turned his focus on installations and gallery work, and exhibited at China Museum of Digital Art, (Beijing), Art Basel Miami and Sundance film festival 2013.\n\nIn 2013, Lemercier founded a creative studio in NYC, focused on research and development of artworks and experiments that use projected light in space.\n\nHe is represented by Muriel Guepin Gallery in New York City.\nGray Area\nhttp://grayarea.org/\nhttp://www.meetup.com/GrayArea/\nhttps://twitter.com/GrayAreaorg","channel_id":"UCW12UmkdiMFyiC0BO15YRfA","channel_url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW12UmkdiMFyiC0BO15YRfA","duration":1780,"webpage_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Og3nODyITSY","tags":["+Gray","Area","Foundation","for","the","arts","Organization","+Art","+Tech","and","Technology","Theater"],"upload_date":"20180218","playlist":"2017 Gray Area Festival","playlist_id":"PLm8zJ0HKEJIYAk9rAz1CQmE9Pzn8G_hrq","playlist_title":"2017 Gray Area Festival","display_id":"Og3nODyITSY","fulltitle":"Joanie Lemercier | the 2017 Gray Area Festival","duration_string":"29:40","width":1920,"height":1080,"fps":30,"aspect_ratio":1.78,"audio_channels":2,"festival_year":"2017","thumbnail_small":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Og3nODyITSY/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCMQBEG5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLAGz-bo6e2k0nXbuQIxpt0EMWcUVA","subtitlesFile":"./data/videos/2017/Joanie Lemercier ｜ the 2017 Gray Area Festival [Og3nODyITSY].en.vtt"},{"id":"PZzXlvnoR5E","title":"Juliette Bibasse | the 2017 Gray Area Festival","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/PZzXlvnoR5E/maxresdefault.webp","description":"Event\nhttp://grayareafestival.io\n\nSpeaker: \nhttp://julietteb.com/\nWith a career in graphic design and artistic direction, Juliette has always appreciated simple aesthetics.

Given the widespread and growing use of such technologies, it is important to better understand their social impacts and to design such technologies to serve the social good. In this talk, Professor Harrell reflects upon how our social identities are complicated by their intersection with computing technologies including videogames, virtual worlds, social media, and related digital media forms – and how we can design experiences involving virtual identities for creative and prosocial needs.\n\n--\n\nD. Fox Harrell, Ph.D., is Professor of Digital Media & Artificial Intelligence in the Comparative Media Studies Program and Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT. He is the director of the MIT Center for Advanced Virtuality.\n\nHis research explores the relationship between imagination and computation. His research involves developing new forms of computational narrative, videogaming for social impact, virtual reality (VR), and related digital media forms based in computer science, cognitive science, and digital media arts. The National Science Foundation recognized Harrell with an NSF CAREER Award for his project “Computing for Advanced Identity Representation.” He has worked as an interactive television producer and as a game designer. His book Phantasmal Media: An Approach to Imagination, Computation, and Expression was published by the MIT Press (2013).\n\nGray Area\nhttp://grayarea.org/\nhttps://twitter.com/GrayAreaorg\nhttps://www.facebook.com/grayarea\n\n=======\ntitle: Reflections on the Avatar Dream\nfeatured: D.

Except us.””\n\nLawrence Lek presents a guided playthrough and soundtrack for his ongoing open-world game ‘2065’. Set within the fictional universe of his CGI film ‘Geomancer’, the game explores a future where AI has supplanted human creativity and automation has created a new culture of entertainment. The virtual world expands each year to incorporate the physical galleries where it has been exhibited. First commissioned for K11 Art Space in Hong Kong (2018), the game now includes the Barbican Centre in London (2019) and the Asian Civilisations Museum in Singapore (2020).\n\n--\n\nLawrence Lek 陆明龙 is a London-based artist, filmmaker, and musician who unifies diverse practices—CGI, audio-visual performance, gaming, and fiction—into a continuously expanding cinematic universe. His works include the CGI film ‘AIDOL’ (2019), the open-world video game ‘2065’ (2018), the AI-coming-of-age story ‘Geomancer’ (2017), the video essay ‘Sinofuturism (1839-2046 AD)’ (2016), and ‘Nøtel’, a simulation of a fully-automated luxury hotel in collaboration with Kode9 (2015). Lek composes soundtracks and conducts live audio-visual mixes of his works, often incorporating playthroughs of his virtual worlds. His most recent release is Temple OST, the soundtrack to a site-specific installation at 180 The Strand, London (The Vinyl Factory 2020).

Over the years there were many attempts at destroying this jinn, but none were successful.\n\nOne day, an old man living in a cave comes forth to reignite hope with a revelation: the only way to kill the snake is to hold a mirror in front of her. When people do so, and the snake sees her own image in the mirror, she starts laughing. She laughs for days and nights until she self-destructs and dies. Re-writing and re-figuring the story of The Laughing Snake, Allahyari will speak on and perform a series of personal and imagined stories in relationship to hysteria, delirium, sexual abuse, impositions of morality, and the experience of living in a female body in the Middle East, in which she reconsiders the snake’s laughter as a position of power; with her self-destruction as an act of ultimate agency over her own body and image.\n\n-- \n\nMorehshin Allahyari (Persian: موره شین اللهیاری; born 1985) is an Iranian-Kurdish media artist, activist, and writer based in Brooklyn, New York. Morehshin Allahyari is a media artist and activist who uses computer modeling, 3D scanning, and digital fabrication techniques to explore the intersection of art and activism. Inspired by concepts of collective archiving and cultural contradiction, Allahyari’s 3D-printed sculptures and videos challenge social and gender norms. She wants her work to respond to, resist, and criticize the current political and cultural situation that is experienced on a daily basis. Her work has been part of numerous exhibitions, festivals, and workshops at venues throughout the world, including the New Museum, MoMa, Centre Pompidou, Venice Biennale di Archittectura, and Museum für Angewandte Kunst among many others. She is the recipient of The Joan Mitchell Foundation Painters & Sculptors Grant (2019), The Sundance Institute New Frontier International Fellowship, and the leading global thinkers of 2016 award by Foreign Policy magazine. Her 3D Additivist Manifesto video is in the collection of San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and recently she has been awarded major commissions by The Shed, Rhizome, New Museum, Whitney Museum of American Art, Liverpool Biennale, and FACT.\n\nhttp://www.morehshin.com/\n\nGray Area\nhttp://grayarea.org/\nhttps://twitter.com/GrayAreaorg\nhttps://www.facebook.com/grayarea\n\n=======\nfeatured: Morehshin Allahyari\ntitle: She Who Sees The Unknown: The Laughing Snake\nfeatured_url: http://www.morehshin.com/\nfestival_year: 2020","channel_id":"UCW12UmkdiMFyiC0BO15YRfA","channel_url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW12UmkdiMFyiC0BO15YRfA","duration":3225,"webpage_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5KKOP38v90","tags":["+Gray","Area","Foundation","for","the","arts","Organization","+Art","+Tech","and","Technology","Theater"],"upload_date":"20201008","playlist":"2020 Gray Area Festival","playlist_id":"PLm8zJ0HKEJIaarwTpOzGg4DXXVLWy2GVU","playlist_title":"2020 Gray Area Festival","display_id":"w5KKOP38v90","fulltitle":"Morehshin Allahyari | Gray Area Festival 2020","duration_string":"53:45","width":1280,"height":720,"fps":30,"aspect_ratio":1.78,"audio_channels":2,"festival_year":"2020","meta_featured":"Morehshin Allahyari","meta_title":"She Who Sees The Unknown: The Laughing Snake","meta_featured_url":"http://www.morehshin.com/","meta_festival_year":"2020","thumbnail_small":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w5KKOP38v90/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCMQBEG5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLBjfg1KXhSZFmTMMSGSXmcJhsFXmw","subtitlesFile":"./data/videos/2020/Morehshin Allahyari ｜ Gray Area Festival 2020 [w5KKOP38v90].en.vtt"},{"id":"xbEWtEzdTEU","title":"Phazero | Gray Area Festival 2020","thumbnail":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/xbEWtEzdTEU/maxresdefault.webp","description":"Gray Area Festival \nhttp://grayareafestival.io/\n\nPurple Unicorn Diaries: A Day in the Life of a Multi-sectional Game Designer\nWhile hanging out in their game “Game Design…the Game?”, Phazero (Art Game and AAA Game Designer) will show the behind the scenes process of creating their AAArt games, talk about how they transitioned into gamed from Fine Arts, “breaking (falling) into the industry” and daily life as a AAA game designer who comes from more of a background in Video Art than Video Games.\n\n--\n\nPhazero is a multi-disciplinary game designer and researcher specialized in player experience and narrative design.
