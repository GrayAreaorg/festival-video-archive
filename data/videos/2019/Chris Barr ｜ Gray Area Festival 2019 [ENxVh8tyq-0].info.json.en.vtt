about that what I like about it for me
 

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.290 align:start position:0%
about that what I like about it for me
it<00:15:41.410><c> really</c><00:15:41.680><c> sort</c><00:15:42.100><c> of</c><00:15:42.190><c> matches</c><00:15:42.610><c> up</c><00:15:42.790><c> with</c><00:15:43.060><c> this</c>

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:43.300 align:start position:0%
it really sort of matches up with this
 

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:48.150 align:start position:0%
it really sort of matches up with this
sort<00:15:44.290><c> of</c><00:15:44.410><c> 5e</c><00:15:45.480><c> model</c><00:15:46.480><c> of</c><00:15:46.810><c> of</c><00:15:47.110><c> experience</c><00:15:47.860><c> right</c>

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
sort of 5e model of of experience right
 

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
sort of 5e model of of experience right
so<00:15:48.490><c> this</c><00:15:49.120><c> notion</c><00:15:49.450><c> of</c><00:15:49.870><c> we</c><00:15:50.320><c> have</c><00:15:50.500><c> an</c><00:15:50.620><c> overarching</c>

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:51.070 align:start position:0%
so this notion of we have an overarching
