00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:28.370 align:start position:0%
like alter generation has been
 

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:31.030 align:start position:0%
like alter generation has been
experienced<00:13:29.270><c> about</c><00:13:29.570><c> that</c><00:13:29.930><c> historical</c><00:13:30.560><c> events</c>

experienced about that historical events
 

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.660 align:start position:0%
experienced about that historical events
but<00:13:31.070><c> for</c><00:13:31.670><c> younger</c><00:13:32.410><c> generations</c><00:13:33.410><c> to</c><00:13:33.800><c> me</c><00:13:34.040><c> it</c><00:13:34.490><c> was</c>

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:34.670 align:start position:0%
but for younger generations to me it was
 

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
but for younger generations to me it was
so<00:13:34.910><c> in</c><00:13:35.740><c> inexperience</c><00:13:36.740><c> and</c><00:13:37.010><c> it's</c><00:13:37.370><c> a</c><00:13:37.550><c> history</c>

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:37.970 align:start position:0%
so in inexperience and it's a history
 

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.210 align:start position:0%
so in inexperience and it's a history
basically<00:13:38.210><c> so</c><00:13:39.080><c> we</c><00:13:39.290><c> just</c><00:13:39.530><c> learned</c><00:13:39.830><c> from</c><00:13:40.010><c> that</c>

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:40.220 align:start position:0%
basically so we just learned from that
 

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.030 align:start position:0%
basically so we just learned from that
from<00:13:40.760><c> the</c><00:13:40.880><c> textbook</c><00:13:41.300><c> so</c><00:13:41.750><c> I</c><00:13:42.020><c> was</c><00:13:42.200><c> asking</c><00:13:42.800><c> like</c>

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
from the textbook so I was asking like
 

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:45.310 align:start position:0%
from the textbook so I was asking like
oh<00:13:43.250><c> we</c><00:13:43.820><c> have</c><00:13:44.030><c> an</c><00:13:44.180><c> in</c><00:13:44.360><c> emotionally</c>

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
oh we have an in emotionally
 

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.370 align:start position:0%
oh we have an in emotionally
disconnected<00:13:46.060><c> to</c><00:13:47.060><c> each</c><00:13:47.210><c> other</c><00:13:47.450><c> so</c><00:13:47.930><c> we</c><00:13:48.110><c> got</c><00:13:48.260><c> to</c>

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:48.380 align:start position:0%
disconnected to each other so we got to
 

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
disconnected to each other so we got to
talk<00:13:48.740><c> about</c><00:13:48.770><c> like</c><00:13:49.220><c> that</c><00:13:49.370><c> so</c><00:13:49.790><c> what</c><00:13:50.780><c> if</c><00:13:50.900><c> I</c>

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:51.910 align:start position:0%
talk about like that so what if I
 

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:56.200 align:start position:0%
talk about like that so what if I

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
basically you can't just anticipate or
 

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
basically you can't just anticipate or
we<00:18:25.180><c> can't</c><00:18:25.840><c> imagine</c><00:18:26.320><c> how</c><00:18:26.560><c> audience</c><00:18:27.280><c> will</c><00:18:27.550><c> react</c>
