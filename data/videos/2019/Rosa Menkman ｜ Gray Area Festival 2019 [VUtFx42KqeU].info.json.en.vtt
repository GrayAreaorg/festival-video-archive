00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 align:start position:0%
something in a wrapper that wrapper kind

these like learning moments and then I
 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.879 align:start position:0%
these like learning moments and then I

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
so that's where they quit yeah and then
 

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.460 align:start position:0%
so that's where they quit yeah and then
I<00:07:56.370><c> started</c><00:07:56.670><c> to</c><00:07:56.850><c> project</c><00:07:57.420><c> this</c><00:07:57.570><c> not</c><00:07:57.750><c> just</c><00:07:57.900><c> in</c><00:07:58.080><c> VR</c>

00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:58.470 align:start position:0%

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
the ultimate empathy machine you know I
 

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.890 align:start position:0%
the ultimate empathy machine you know I
do<00:16:44.850><c> you</c><00:16:44.910><c> see</c><00:16:45.120><c> where</c><00:16:45.270><c> I'm</c><00:16:45.360><c> getting</c><00:16:45.540><c> and</c><00:16:45.720><c> it's</c><00:16:45.810><c> a</c>

little bit exploitative I thought like
 

00:16:47.610 --> 00:16:51.340 align:start position:0%

and<00:16:47.910><c> you</c><00:16:47.970><c> also</c><00:16:48.120><c> have</c><00:16:48.390><c> empathy</c><00:16:49.200><c> without</c><00:16:49.500><c> young</c>

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:51.350 align:start position:0%
and you also have empathy without young
 

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:56.330 align:start position:0%
and you also have empathy without young

00:16:59.060 --> 00:16:59.070 align:start position:0%
put it in there so what's happening is I
 

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
put it in there so what's happening is I
