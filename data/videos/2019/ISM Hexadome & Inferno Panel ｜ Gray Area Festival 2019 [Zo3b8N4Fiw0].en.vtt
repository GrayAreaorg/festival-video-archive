00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:21.980 align:start position:0%
you're in your studio maybe you can have
 

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.490 align:start position:0%
you're in your studio maybe you can have
a<00:09:22.010><c> few</c><00:09:22.370><c> friends</c><00:09:22.820><c> around</c><00:09:22.940><c> to</c><00:09:23.420><c> invite</c><00:09:23.960><c> and</c><00:09:24.260><c> try</c>

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:24.500 align:start position:0%
a few friends around to invite and try
 

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
a few friends around to invite and try
it<00:09:24.560><c> out</c>

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:25.010 align:start position:0%
it out
 

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.730 align:start position:0%
it out
so<00:09:25.820><c> the</c><00:09:26.360><c> first</c><00:09:26.570><c> time</c><00:09:26.780><c> we</c><00:09:26.900><c> did</c><00:09:27.050><c> ever</c><00:09:27.320><c> perform</c>

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:27.740 align:start position:0%
so the first time we did ever perform
 

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
so the first time we did ever perform
this<00:09:27.890><c> were</c><00:09:28.070><c> absolutely</c><00:09:28.520><c> no</c><00:09:28.820><c> clue</c><00:09:29.120><c> of</c><00:09:29.630><c> what</c>

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:30.050 align:start position:0%
this were absolutely no clue of what
 

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.710 align:start position:0%
this were absolutely no clue of what
would<00:09:30.200><c> happen</c><00:09:30.590><c> because</c><00:09:31.400><c> we</c><00:09:31.820><c> never</c><00:09:32.240><c> tried</c><00:09:32.570><c> it</c>

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
would happen because we never tried it
 

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.100 align:start position:0%
would happen because we never tried it
so<00:09:32.870><c> the</c><00:09:33.560><c> first</c><00:09:33.800><c> time</c><00:09:34.010><c> was</c><00:09:34.190><c> really</c><00:09:34.490><c> like</c><00:09:35.050><c> not</c><00:09:36.050><c> a</c>

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:36.110 align:start position:0%
so the first time was really like not a
 

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:37.810 align:start position:0%
so the first time was really like not a
soft<00:09:36.440><c> launch</c><00:09:36.620><c> there</c><00:09:36.890><c> was</c><00:09:37.010><c> a</c><00:09:37.040><c> hard</c><00:09:37.310><c> launch</c><00:09:37.490><c> -</c>

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:37.820 align:start position:0%
soft launch there was a hard launch -
 

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.970 align:start position:0%
soft launch there was a hard launch -
okay<00:09:38.180><c> let's</c><00:09:38.450><c> see</c><00:09:38.720><c> it</c><00:09:38.840><c> and</c><00:09:39.110><c> it</c><00:09:39.620><c> was</c><00:09:39.770><c> quite</c>

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:39.980 align:start position:0%
okay let's see it and it was quite
 

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.250 align:start position:0%
okay let's see it and it was quite
curious<00:09:40.520><c> for</c><00:09:40.910><c> us</c><00:09:41.030><c> as</c><00:09:41.360><c> we</c><00:09:41.570><c> were</c><00:09:41.720><c> discovering</c>

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:42.260 align:start position:0%
curious for us as we were discovering
 

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
curious for us as we were discovering
what<00:09:42.650><c> was</c><00:09:42.800><c> happening</c><00:09:43.220><c> as</c><00:09:43.340><c> it</c><00:09:43.490><c> goes</c><00:09:43.670><c> so</c><00:09:43.700><c> I</c><00:09:44.150><c> would</c>

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:44.570 align:start position:0%
what was happening as it goes so I would
 

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
what was happening as it goes so I would
say<00:09:44.690><c> that's</c><00:09:44.900><c> our</c><00:09:45.020><c> our</c><00:09:45.410><c> own</c><00:09:45.830><c> first</c><00:09:46.370><c> that's</c><00:09:46.700><c> a</c>

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:47.530 align:start position:0%
say that's our our own first that's a
 

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
say that's our our own first that's a
discovery<00:09:48.530><c> or</c><00:09:48.800><c> a</c><00:09:49.120><c> magical</c><00:09:50.120><c> moment</c><00:09:50.270><c> but</c><00:09:50.660><c> I</c>

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:50.690 align:start position:0%
discovery or a magical moment but I
 

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.910 align:start position:0%
discovery or a magical moment but I
think<00:09:51.430><c> the</c><00:09:52.870><c> the</c><00:09:53.870><c> thing</c><00:09:54.080><c> that</c><00:09:54.200><c> happened</c><00:09:54.530><c> most</c>

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
think the the thing that happened most
 

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
think the the thing that happened most
that<00:09:55.550><c> is</c><00:09:56.350><c> known</c><00:09:57.350><c> as</c><00:09:57.470><c> a</c><00:09:57.590><c> surprising</c><00:09:58.250><c> but</c><00:09:58.430><c> the</c>

00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:58.970 align:start position:0%
that is known as a surprising but the
 

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:03.010 align:start position:0%
that is known as a surprising but the
paradox<00:09:59.540><c> of</c><00:09:59.720><c> it</c><00:09:59.870><c> is</c><00:10:00.110><c> that</c><00:10:00.410><c> the</c><00:10:01.390><c> people</c><00:10:02.390><c> enjoy</c>

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:03.020 align:start position:0%
paradox of it is that the people enjoy
 

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.080 align:start position:0%
paradox of it is that the people enjoy
it<00:10:03.320><c> when</c><00:10:03.680><c> they</c><00:10:03.800><c> let</c><00:10:03.830><c> themself</c><00:10:04.580><c> go</c>

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:05.090 align:start position:0%
it when they let themself go
 

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.180 align:start position:0%
it when they let themself go
so<00:10:05.540><c> the</c><00:10:05.780><c> and</c><00:10:06.110><c> they</c><00:10:06.230><c> all</c><00:10:06.350><c> say</c><00:10:06.710><c> that</c><00:10:06.740><c> there</c>

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:07.190 align:start position:0%
so the and they all say that there
 

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:09.490 align:start position:0%
so the and they all say that there
there's<00:10:07.370><c> a</c><00:10:07.430><c> kind</c><00:10:07.640><c> of</c><00:10:07.730><c> some</c><00:10:08.150><c> strange</c><00:10:08.900><c> trends</c>

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:09.500 align:start position:0%
there's a kind of some strange trends
 

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
there's a kind of some strange trends
like<00:10:10.030><c> moment</c><00:10:11.030><c> that</c><00:10:11.330><c> happens</c><00:10:11.840><c> at</c><00:10:12.050><c> one</c><00:10:12.230><c> point</c><00:10:12.500><c> so</c>

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:12.890 align:start position:0%
like moment that happens at one point so
 

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:15.460 align:start position:0%
like moment that happens at one point so
I'm<00:10:13.640><c> not</c><00:10:13.850><c> sure</c><00:10:13.910><c> if</c><00:10:14.120><c> I</c><00:10:14.210><c> can</c><00:10:14.390><c> see</c><00:10:14.780><c> it</c><00:10:14.900><c> in</c><00:10:15.080><c> the</c><00:10:15.200><c> face</c>

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:15.470 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I can see it in the face
 

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:17.260 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if I can see it in the face
of<00:10:15.680><c> the</c><00:10:15.770><c> person</c><00:10:16.160><c> doing</c><00:10:16.400><c> it</c><00:10:16.580><c> because</c><00:10:16.910><c> we</c><00:10:17.060><c> bit</c>

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:17.270 align:start position:0%
of the person doing it because we bit
 

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.999 align:start position:0%
of the person doing it because we bit

00:10:19.999 --> 00:10:20.009 align:start position:0%
busy with their computers but I
 

00:10:20.009 --> 00:10:23.329 align:start position:0%
busy with their computers but I
but<00:10:20.399><c> and</c><00:10:21.089><c> there's</c><00:10:21.509><c> also</c><00:10:21.689><c> of</c><00:10:22.110><c> course</c><00:10:22.319><c> the</c><00:10:22.649><c> scary</c>

00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:23.339 align:start position:0%
but and there's also of course the scary
 

00:10:23.339 --> 00:10:24.650 align:start position:0%
but and there's also of course the scary
moment<00:10:23.819><c> at</c><00:10:23.939><c> the</c><00:10:23.999><c> beginning</c><00:10:24.089><c> because</c><00:10:24.480><c> you</c><00:10:24.569><c> have</c>

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
moment at the beginning because you have
 

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.900 align:start position:0%
moment at the beginning because you have
no<00:10:24.810><c> clue</c><00:10:25.170><c> so</c><00:10:25.199><c> this</c><00:10:25.949><c> is</c><00:10:26.069><c> always</c><00:10:26.249><c> fun</c><00:10:26.399><c> there's</c>

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:26.910 align:start position:0%
no clue so this is always fun there's
 

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.790 align:start position:0%
no clue so this is always fun there's
always<00:10:27.089><c> a</c><00:10:27.240><c> lot</c><00:10:27.449><c> of</c><00:10:27.600><c> nervous</c><00:10:28.110><c> laughs</c><00:10:28.410><c> at</c><00:10:28.709><c> the</c>

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
always a lot of nervous laughs at the
 

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.759 align:start position:0%
always a lot of nervous laughs at the
beginning<00:10:29.220><c> so</c><00:10:29.430><c> we</c><00:10:30.089><c> kind</c><00:10:30.689><c> of</c><00:10:30.749><c> like</c><00:10:30.930><c> I'm</c><00:10:31.499><c> kind</c><00:10:31.740><c> of</c>

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:31.769 align:start position:0%

00:10:31.769 --> 00:10:33.980 align:start position:0%

and<00:16:53.520><c> so</c><00:16:53.700><c> I</c><00:16:53.910><c> think</c><00:16:54.240><c> that</c><00:16:54.890><c> and</c><00:16:55.890><c> it's</c><00:16:56.100><c> becoming</c>

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:56.520 align:start position:0%

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.769 align:start position:0%
and so I think that and it's becoming

more and more the way you can do multi

more and more the way you can do multi
