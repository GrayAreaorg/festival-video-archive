and also we've got a structure where
 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.309 align:start position:0%
and also we've got a structure where
they<00:02:08.479><c> they</c><00:02:09.479><c> gain</c><00:02:09.690><c> points</c><00:02:10.160><c> from</c><00:02:12.110><c> like</c><00:02:13.110><c> their</c>

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
they they gain points from like their
 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.199 align:start position:0%
they they gain points from like their
behavior<00:02:13.770><c> basically</c><00:02:13.980><c> and</c><00:02:14.640><c> it's</c><00:02:14.819><c> about</c><00:02:15.000><c> their</c>

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 align:start position:0%
behavior basically and it's about their
 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.089 align:start position:0%
behavior basically and it's about their
ability<00:02:15.840><c> to</c><00:02:15.989><c> kind</c><00:02:16.170><c> of</c><00:02:16.349><c> like</c><00:02:16.610><c> coexist</c><00:02:17.610><c> in</c><00:02:17.940><c> a</c>

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 align:start position:0%
ability to kind of like coexist in a
 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.620 align:start position:0%
ability to kind of like coexist in a

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 align:start position:0%
harmonious way with everybody else and
 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
harmonious way with everybody else and
so<00:02:22.760><c> they</c><00:02:23.760><c> sort</c><00:02:24.390><c> of</c><00:02:24.450><c> realized</c><00:02:24.720><c> quite</c><00:02:25.200><c> quickly</c><00:02:25.260><c> I</c>

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 align:start position:0%
so they sort of realized quite quickly I
 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.460 align:start position:0%
so they sort of realized quite quickly I
guess<00:02:25.950><c> that</c><00:02:26.310><c> you</c><00:02:26.519><c> know</c><00:02:26.550><c> if</c><00:02:26.910><c> they</c><00:02:27.120><c> behave</c><00:02:28.019><c> in</c>

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 align:start position:0%
guess that you know if they behave in
 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.250 align:start position:0%
guess that you know if they behave in
certain<00:02:28.680><c> ways</c><00:02:28.950><c> and</c><00:02:29.790><c> like</c><00:02:30.599><c> you</c><00:02:30.870><c> know</c><00:02:30.989><c> for</c><00:02:31.200><c> the</c>

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
certain ways and like you know for the
 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.770 align:start position:0%
certain ways and like you know for the
good<00:02:31.440><c> of</c><00:02:31.470><c> the</c><00:02:31.709><c> rest</c><00:02:31.920><c> of</c><00:02:32.160><c> the</c><00:02:32.310><c> society</c><00:02:33.030><c> then</c>

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
good of the rest of the society then
 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.500 align:start position:0%
good of the rest of the society then
they<00:02:34.080><c> gain</c><00:02:34.319><c> these</c><00:02:34.500><c> kind</c><00:02:34.799><c> of</c><00:02:34.920><c> like</c><00:02:35.510><c> this</c>

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 align:start position:0%
they gain these kind of like this
 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
they gain these kind of like this
currency<00:02:37.069><c> basically</c><00:02:38.069><c> so</c><00:02:39.470><c> yeah</c><00:02:40.470><c> it's</c><00:02:40.680><c> kind</c><00:02:40.950><c> of</c>

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 align:start position:0%
currency basically so yeah it's kind of
 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.890 align:start position:0%
currency basically so yeah it's kind of
