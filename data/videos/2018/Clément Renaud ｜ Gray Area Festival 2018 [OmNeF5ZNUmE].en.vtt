changjun which is basically I mean I'm
pretty<00:00:24.930><c> sure</c><00:00:25.170><c> you've</c><00:00:25.650><c> heard</c><00:00:25.949><c> about</c><00:00:26.070><c> the</c><00:00:26.250><c> city</c>

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 align:start position:0%
pretty sure you've heard about the city
 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.460 align:start position:0%
pretty sure you've heard about the city
but<00:00:26.820><c> I</c><00:00:26.849><c> wanted</c><00:00:27.119><c> to</c><00:00:27.180><c> like</c><00:00:27.480><c> give</c><00:00:27.750><c> some</c><00:00:27.930><c> context</c>

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 align:start position:0%
but I wanted to like give some context
 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.839 align:start position:0%
but I wanted to like give some context
and<00:00:28.590><c> I</c><00:00:28.680><c> think</c><00:00:28.890><c> it's</c><00:00:29.010><c> a</c><00:00:29.039><c> very</c><00:00:29.220><c> important</c><00:00:29.760><c> place</c>

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 align:start position:0%
and I think it's a very important place
 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.799 align:start position:0%
and I think it's a very important place
or<00:00:30.240><c> today</c><00:00:31.579><c> it's</c><00:00:32.579><c> like</c><00:00:32.730><c> defining</c><00:00:33.090><c> many</c><00:00:33.390><c> many</c>

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 align:start position:0%
or today it's like defining many many
 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.410 align:start position:0%
or today it's like defining many many
things<00:00:33.989><c> in</c><00:00:34.170><c> technology</c><00:00:34.290><c> and</c><00:00:34.920><c> I'm</c><00:00:35.040><c> I'm</c><00:00:35.520><c> as</c><00:00:36.210><c> I'm</c>

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 align:start position:0%
of course the main reason is because
 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.210 align:start position:0%
of course the main reason is because
it's<00:01:18.060><c> made</c><00:01:18.299><c> there</c><00:01:18.570><c> so</c><00:01:19.290><c> I</c><00:01:19.320><c> given</c><00:01:19.619><c> this</c><00:01:19.770><c> computer</c>

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 align:start position:0%
it's made there so I given this computer

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:01.850 align:start position:0%
really custom-made for there and I mean
 

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:03.730 align:start position:0%
really custom-made for there and I mean
it's<00:17:02.000><c> not</c><00:17:02.150><c> like</c><00:17:02.360><c> it's</c><00:17:02.690><c> a</c><00:17:02.840><c> huge</c><00:17:03.080><c> engineering</c>

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:03.740 align:start position:0%
it's not like it's a huge engineering
 

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:04.930 align:start position:0%
it's not like it's a huge engineering
process<00:17:04.190><c> with</c><00:17:04.400><c> like</c><00:17:04.580><c> Design</c><00:17:04.910><c> Thinking</c>

arriving there and being like oh wait we
 

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
arriving there and being like oh wait we
should<00:17:09.830><c> assemble</c><00:17:10.250><c> this</c><00:17:10.550><c> like</c><00:17:10.700><c> power</c><00:17:10.940><c> bank</c>

00:17:11.199 --> 00:17:11.209 align:start position:0%
should assemble this like power bank
 

00:17:11.209 --> 00:17:13.090 align:start position:0%
should assemble this like power bank
with<00:17:11.420><c> these</c><00:17:11.570><c> phones</c><00:17:11.839><c> we</c><00:17:12.080><c> will</c><00:17:12.170><c> be</c><00:17:12.290><c> input</c><00:17:12.560><c> for</c>

with these phones we will be input for
 

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:15.100 align:start position:0%
with these phones we will be input for

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:27.860 align:start position:0%
then sell them so like the product cycle
 

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
then sell them so like the product cycle
is<00:17:27.980><c> actually</c><00:17:28.400><c> different</c><00:17:28.580><c> in</c><00:17:29.140><c> whatever</c><00:17:30.140><c> we</c><00:17:30.470><c> can</c>

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:30.650 align:start position:0%
is actually different in whatever we can
 

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:32.770 align:start position:0%
is actually different in whatever we can

00:17:32.770 --> 00:17:32.780 align:start position:0%
learn some design school or something
 

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
learn some design school or something
and<00:17:32.870><c> also</c><00:17:33.580><c> it's</c><00:17:34.580><c> a</c><00:17:34.670><c> way</c><00:17:34.820><c> I</c><00:17:34.850><c> mean</c><00:17:35.060><c> it's</c><00:17:35.240><c> like</c><00:17:35.420><c> a</c>

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:35.450 align:start position:0%
and also it's a way I mean it's like a
 

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:38.290 align:start position:0%
and also it's a way I mean it's like a

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:41.690 align:start position:0%
addressing because I mean Apple doesn't
 

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.610 align:start position:0%

care<00:17:41.960><c> about</c><00:17:42.050><c> workers</c><00:17:42.620><c> or</c><00:17:43.070><c> power</c><00:17:43.400><c> in</c><00:17:43.580><c> either</c><00:17:43.750><c> so</c>

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:45.620 align:start position:0%
care about workers or power in either so
 

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.169 align:start position:0%
care about workers or power in either so
and<00:17:45.740><c> it</c><00:17:45.860><c> let's</c><00:17:46.070><c> do</c><00:17:46.220><c> like</c><00:17:46.370><c> this</c><00:17:46.490><c> famous</c><00:17:46.760><c> sing</c>

that all sorts of weird fans like in and
 

00:17:52.789 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
that all sorts of weird fans like in and
weird<00:17:53.419><c> objects</c><00:17:53.900><c> that</c><00:17:54.049><c> are</c><00:17:54.260><c> basically</c><00:17:54.650><c> Shan</c>

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:54.890 align:start position:0%
weird objects that are basically Shan
 

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:57.330 align:start position:0%
weird objects that are basically Shan
Zhai<00:17:55.010><c> in</c><00:17:55.130><c> Chinese</c><00:17:55.460><c> means</c><00:17:55.700><c> like</c><00:17:56.320><c> low-quality</c>

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:57.340 align:start position:0%
Zhai in Chinese means like low-quality
 

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:00.010 align:start position:0%
Zhai in Chinese means like low-quality
knockoff<00:17:58.340><c> basically</c><00:17:59.330><c> means</c><00:17:59.510><c> made</c><00:17:59.720><c> in</c><00:17:59.840><c> China</c>

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:00.020 align:start position:0%
knockoff basically means made in China
 

00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
knockoff basically means made in China
for<00:18:00.679><c> the</c><00:18:00.740><c> Chinese</c><00:18:01.929><c> and</c><00:18:03.159><c> yeah</c><00:18:04.159><c> I</c><00:18:04.190><c> mean</c><00:18:04.490><c> that's</c>

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:04.610 align:start position:0%
for the Chinese and yeah I mean that's
 

00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:07.330 align:start position:0%
for the Chinese and yeah I mean that's
pretty<00:18:04.850><c> much</c><00:18:04.940><c> true</c><00:18:05.000><c> and</c><00:18:05.770><c> so</c><00:18:06.770><c> we</c><00:18:06.919><c> have</c><00:18:07.039><c> started</c>

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:07.340 align:start position:0%
