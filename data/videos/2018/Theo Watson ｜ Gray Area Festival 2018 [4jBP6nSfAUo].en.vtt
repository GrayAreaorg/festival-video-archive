00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
on where the time
 

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.590 align:start position:0%
on where the time
you<00:09:17.639><c> could</c><00:09:17.790><c> like</c><00:09:17.940><c> move</c><00:09:18.089><c> the</c><00:09:18.240><c> needle</c><00:09:18.509><c> around</c>

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
you could like move the needle around
 

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
you could like move the needle around
and<00:09:19.139><c> it</c><00:09:19.230><c> would</c><00:09:19.380><c> actually</c><00:09:19.529><c> react</c><00:09:20.339><c> the</c><00:09:20.490><c> same</c><00:09:20.639><c> we</c>

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:20.850 align:start position:0%
and it would actually react the same we
 

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:22.430 align:start position:0%
and it would actually react the same we
actually<00:09:21.089><c> had</c><00:09:21.180><c> the</c><00:09:21.269><c> audio</c><00:09:21.570><c> on</c><00:09:21.750><c> one</c><00:09:21.959><c> channel</c><00:09:22.410><c> on</c>

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
actually had the audio on one channel on
 

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.290 align:start position:0%
actually had the audio on one channel on
the<00:09:22.560><c> left</c><00:09:22.769><c> channel</c><00:09:22.980><c> and</c><00:09:23.160><c> the</c><00:09:23.639><c> timecode</c><00:09:24.060><c> on</c><00:09:24.209><c> the</c>

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
the left channel and the timecode on the
 

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.410 align:start position:0%
the left channel and the timecode on the
right<00:09:24.449><c> channel</c><00:09:25.610><c> so</c><00:09:26.610><c> this</c><00:09:26.730><c> was</c><00:09:26.880><c> a</c><00:09:26.910><c> huge</c><00:09:27.149><c> relief</c>

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
right channel so this was a huge relief
 

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:28.519 align:start position:0%
right channel so this was a huge relief
once<00:09:27.630><c> we</c><00:09:27.779><c> realized</c><00:09:28.110><c> that</c><00:09:28.170><c> we</c><00:09:28.320><c> could</c><00:09:28.440><c> actually</c>

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:28.529 align:start position:0%
once we realized that we could actually
 

00:09:28.529 --> 00:09:30.170 align:start position:0%
once we realized that we could actually
do<00:09:28.980><c> this</c><00:09:29.160><c> and</c><00:09:29.519><c> then</c><00:09:29.670><c> here</c><00:09:29.850><c> is</c><00:09:29.940><c> just</c><00:09:30.120><c> showing</c>

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
do this and then here is just showing
 

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.360 align:start position:0%
do this and then here is just showing
kind<00:09:30.720><c> of</c><00:09:30.810><c> the</c><00:09:31.230><c> first</c><00:09:31.410><c> time</c><00:09:31.560><c> you</c><00:09:31.709><c> connected</c><00:09:32.250><c> it</c>

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:32.370 align:start position:0%
kind of the first time you connected it
 

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:35.629 align:start position:0%
kind of the first time you connected it
to<00:09:33.269><c> the</c><00:09:33.720><c> album</c><00:09:34.110><c> and</c><00:09:34.410><c> oh</c><00:09:34.589><c> you</c><00:09:35.279><c> know</c><00:09:35.370><c> we</c><00:09:35.519><c> could</c>

00:09:35.629 --> 00:09:35.639 align:start position:0%
to the album and oh you know we could
 

00:09:35.639 --> 00:09:37.009 align:start position:0%
to the album and oh you know we could
switch<00:09:35.880><c> the</c><00:09:36.060><c> track</c><00:09:36.300><c> and</c><00:09:36.569><c> suddenly</c><00:09:36.870><c> the</c>

00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:37.019 align:start position:0%
switch the track and suddenly the
 

00:09:37.019 --> 00:09:38.930 align:start position:0%
switch the track and suddenly the

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
visuals would jump it would reload all
 

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:46.430 align:start position:0%
visuals would jump it would reload all

you need actually to run it you need
 

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
you need actually to run it you need
this<00:10:04.740><c> like</c><00:10:04.949><c> custom</c><00:10:05.490><c> server</c><00:10:06.000><c> just</c><00:10:06.569><c> to</c><00:10:06.750><c> connect</c>

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:07.170 align:start position:0%
this like custom server just to connect
 

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:10.510 align:start position:0%
this like custom server just to connect
to<00:10:07.290><c> their</c><00:10:07.440><c> camera</c>

the camera was seeing and see here you
 

00:10:28.089 --> 00:10:30.090 align:start position:0%
the camera was seeing and see here you

00:10:34.769 --> 00:10:34.779 align:start position:0%
sort of dial it in and eventually once
 

00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:37.169 align:start position:0%
sort of dial it in and eventually once
it's<00:10:34.989><c> lined</c><00:10:35.230><c> up</c><00:10:35.470><c> we're</c><00:10:35.920><c> able</c><00:10:36.069><c> to</c><00:10:36.369><c> like</c><00:10:36.699><c> occlude</c>

00:10:37.169 --> 00:10:37.179 align:start position:0%
it's lined up we're able to like occlude
 

00:10:37.179 --> 00:10:39.689 align:start position:0%
it's lined up we're able to like occlude

00:10:43.079 --> 00:10:43.089 align:start position:0%
record player is the 3d object and we
 

00:10:43.089 --> 00:10:45.509 align:start position:0%
record player is the 3d object and we
also<00:10:43.239><c> had</c><00:10:43.420><c> to</c><00:10:43.509><c> build</c><00:10:43.720><c> like</c><00:10:43.899><c> a</c><00:10:43.929><c> stereo</c><00:10:44.519><c> 360</c>

00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
also had to build like a stereo 360
 

00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:46.919 align:start position:0%
also had to build like a stereo 360
renderer<00:10:45.850><c> so</c><00:10:46.119><c> we</c><00:10:46.209><c> had</c><00:10:46.360><c> like</c><00:10:46.540><c> all</c><00:10:46.749><c> this</c>

00:10:46.919 --> 00:10:46.929 align:start position:0%
renderer so we had like all this
 

00:10:46.929 --> 00:10:48.689 align:start position:0%

bounding<00:10:47.350><c> box</c><00:10:47.559><c> stuff</c><00:10:47.889><c> to</c><00:10:48.249><c> be</c><00:10:48.369><c> able</c><00:10:48.429><c> to</c><00:10:48.549><c> know</c>

00:10:48.689 --> 00:10:48.699 align:start position:0%
bounding box stuff to be able to know
 

00:10:48.699 --> 00:10:51.509 align:start position:0%
bounding box stuff to be able to know
which<00:10:48.989><c> which</c><00:10:49.989><c> camera</c><00:10:50.559><c> view</c><00:10:50.769><c> needed</c><00:10:51.129><c> to</c><00:10:51.220><c> render</c>

00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
which which camera view needed to render
 

00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:53.669 align:start position:0%
which which camera view needed to render
what<00:10:51.699><c> and</c><00:10:51.999><c> so</c><00:10:52.239><c> you</c><00:10:52.779><c> know</c><00:10:52.869><c> we</c><00:10:52.989><c> this</c><00:10:53.199><c> so</c><00:10:53.559><c> we</c>

00:10:53.669 --> 00:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
what and so you know we this so we
 

00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
what and so you know we this so we
basically<00:10:54.069><c> render</c><00:10:54.369><c> out</c><00:10:54.549><c> like</c><00:10:54.759><c> a</c><00:10:54.790><c> cube</c><00:10:55.119><c> map</c><00:10:55.329><c> for</c>

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:56.170 align:start position:0%
basically render out like a cube map for
 

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:57.869 align:start position:0%
basically render out like a cube map for
each<00:10:56.319><c> eye</c><00:10:56.559><c> and</c><00:10:56.949><c> then</c><00:10:57.129><c> sort</c><00:10:57.369><c> of</c><00:10:57.429><c> stitch</c><00:10:57.610><c> it</c><00:10:57.790><c> all</c>

00:10:57.869 --> 00:10:57.879 align:start position:0%
each eye and then sort of stitch it all
 

00:10:57.879 --> 00:11:01.079 align:start position:0%

00:11:01.079 --> 00:11:01.089 align:start position:0%
back together with it was just all that
 

00:11:01.089 --> 00:11:02.910 align:start position:0%

was<00:11:01.420><c> sort</c><00:11:01.600><c> of</c><00:11:01.629><c> a</c><00:11:01.720><c> nightmare</c><00:11:01.899><c> it</c><00:11:02.319><c> was</c><00:11:02.350><c> really</c>

00:13:54.699 --> 00:13:54.709 align:start position:0%
camera the video camera was getting and
 

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:56.980 align:start position:0%

then<00:13:55.369><c> on</c><00:13:55.490><c> top</c><00:13:55.910><c> of</c><00:13:56.059><c> that</c><00:13:56.209><c> actually</c><00:13:56.600><c> get</c><00:13:56.779><c> the</c>

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:56.990 align:start position:0%
then on top of that actually get the
 

00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:59.290 align:start position:0%
then on top of that actually get the
Kinect<00:13:57.470><c> to</c><00:13:58.040><c> then</c><00:13:58.220><c> line</c><00:13:58.429><c> up</c><00:13:58.579><c> with</c><00:13:58.850><c> that</c><00:13:59.029><c> so</c><00:13:59.240><c> it</c>

00:13:59.290 --> 00:13:59.300 align:start position:0%
Kinect to then line up with that so it
 

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.759 align:start position:0%
Kinect to then line up with that so it
was<00:13:59.360><c> like</c><00:13:59.509><c> getting</c><00:13:59.660><c> three</c><00:13:59.990><c> systems</c><00:14:00.410><c> to</c><00:14:00.589><c> sort</c>

00:14:00.759 --> 00:14:00.769 align:start position:0%
was like getting three systems to sort
 

00:14:00.769 --> 00:14:02.799 align:start position:0%
was like getting three systems to sort

00:14:02.799 --> 00:14:02.809 align:start position:0%
of line up but when it did this is very
 

00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:05.790 align:start position:0%
of line up but when it did this is very
crude<00:14:03.230><c> and</c><00:14:03.350><c> rough</c><00:14:03.589><c> we</c><00:14:04.369><c> could</c><00:14:04.579><c> like</c><00:14:04.790><c> mask</c><00:14:05.089><c> out</c>

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
crude and rough we could like mask out
 

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.230 align:start position:0%
crude and rough we could like mask out

00:14:10.119 --> 00:14:10.129 align:start position:0%
things that were in the scene be masked
 

00:14:10.129 --> 00:14:12.309 align:start position:0%
things that were in the scene be masked
out<00:14:10.249><c> by</c><00:14:10.459><c> them</c><00:14:10.670><c> and</c><00:14:10.999><c> so</c><00:14:11.629><c> here</c><00:14:11.779><c> you</c><00:14:11.870><c> can</c><00:14:11.959><c> see</c><00:14:12.199><c> him</c>

00:14:12.309 --> 00:14:12.319 align:start position:0%

00:14:12.319 --> 00:14:15.879 align:start position:0%

include what's behind it so this was
 

00:14:19.009 --> 00:14:20.879 align:start position:0%
include what's behind it so this was
this<00:14:19.249><c> was</c><00:14:19.370><c> a</c><00:14:19.429><c> really</c><00:14:19.670><c> happy</c><00:14:20.059><c> moment</c><00:14:20.329><c> for</c><00:14:20.689><c> us</c>

00:14:20.879 --> 00:14:20.889 align:start position:0%
this was a really happy moment for us
 

00:14:20.889 --> 00:14:23.710 align:start position:0%
this was a really happy moment for us
and<00:14:21.889><c> then</c><00:14:22.670><c> once</c><00:14:22.850><c> we</c><00:14:22.999><c> did</c><00:14:23.120><c> that</c><00:14:23.179><c> you</c><00:14:23.540><c> know</c><00:14:23.569><c> we</c>

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
and then once we did that you know we
 

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.179 align:start position:0%
and then once we did that you know we
got<00:14:23.809><c> that</c><00:14:23.870><c> figured</c><00:14:24.379><c> out</c><00:14:24.470><c> we</c><00:14:24.649><c> had</c><00:14:24.800><c> to</c><00:14:24.829><c> do</c><00:14:25.009><c> that</c>

00:14:25.179 --> 00:14:25.189 align:start position:0%
got that figured out we had to do that
 

00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:27.400 align:start position:0%
got that figured out we had to do that
in<00:14:25.490><c> the</c><00:14:25.819><c> Bell</c><00:14:26.089><c> lab</c><00:14:26.329><c> space</c><00:14:26.720><c> so</c><00:14:26.899><c> this</c><00:14:27.019><c> is</c><00:14:27.170><c> sort</c><00:14:27.350><c> of</c>

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:27.410 align:start position:0%
in the Bell lab space so this is sort of
 

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:29.860 align:start position:0%
in the Bell lab space so this is sort of
a<00:14:27.499><c> debug</c><00:14:27.920><c> for</c><00:14:28.100><c> you</c><00:14:28.220><c> to</c><00:14:28.370><c> make</c><00:14:28.519><c> sure</c><00:14:28.600><c> we're</c><00:14:29.600><c> lined</c>

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:29.870 align:start position:0%
a debug for you to make sure we're lined
 

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:31.689 align:start position:0%
a debug for you to make sure we're lined
up<00:14:30.079><c> with</c><00:14:30.259><c> the</c><00:14:30.559><c> perspective</c><00:14:31.339><c> of</c><00:14:31.429><c> the</c><00:14:31.519><c> camera</c>

00:14:31.689 --> 00:14:31.699 align:start position:0%
up with the perspective of the camera
 

00:14:31.699 --> 00:14:35.350 align:start position:0%
up with the perspective of the camera
and<00:14:32.290><c> then</c><00:14:33.290><c> you</c><00:14:34.279><c> know</c><00:14:34.370><c> Nick</c><00:14:34.579><c> would</c><00:14:34.730><c> often</c><00:14:35.029><c> go</c><00:14:35.149><c> in</c>

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
and then you know Nick would often go in
 

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.179 align:start position:0%
and then you know Nick would often go in
and<00:14:35.600><c> we</c><00:14:35.990><c> would</c><00:14:36.079><c> try</c><00:14:36.319><c> and</c><00:14:36.410><c> get</c><00:14:36.529><c> the</c><00:14:36.620><c> Kinect</c><00:14:36.949><c> to</c>

00:14:37.179 --> 00:14:37.189 align:start position:0%
and we would try and get the Kinect to
 

00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:39.369 align:start position:0%
and we would try and get the Kinect to
line<00:14:37.370><c> up</c><00:14:37.550><c> with</c><00:14:37.579><c> the</c><00:14:37.819><c> 4k</c><00:14:38.149><c> camera</c><00:14:38.629><c> and</c><00:14:38.870><c> here</c><00:14:39.259><c> it's</c>

00:14:39.369 --> 00:14:39.379 align:start position:0%
line up with the 4k camera and here it's
 

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:42.759 align:start position:0%
line up with the 4k camera and here it's
a<00:14:39.470><c> bit</c><00:14:39.620><c> more</c><00:14:39.649><c> lined</c><00:14:40.040><c> up</c><00:14:40.189><c> I</c><00:14:40.309><c> think</c><00:14:40.990><c> and</c><00:14:41.990><c> then</c>

00:14:42.759 --> 00:14:42.769 align:start position:0%
a bit more lined up I think and then
 

00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:44.110 align:start position:0%
a bit more lined up I think and then
once<00:14:42.949><c> it</c><00:14:43.100><c> was</c><00:14:43.129><c> lined</c><00:14:43.399><c> up</c><00:14:43.579><c> you</c><00:14:43.759><c> know</c><00:14:43.879><c> we</c><00:14:43.999><c> would</c>

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
once it was lined up you know we would
 

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.379 align:start position:0%
once it was lined up you know we would
sort<00:14:44.329><c> of</c><00:14:44.769><c> test</c><00:14:45.769><c> kind</c><00:14:46.279><c> of</c><00:14:46.370><c> put</c><00:14:46.699><c> on</c><00:14:46.790><c> debug</c><00:14:47.149><c> mode</c>

00:14:47.379 --> 00:14:47.389 align:start position:0%
sort of test kind of put on debug mode
 

00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:49.329 align:start position:0%
sort of test kind of put on debug mode
and<00:14:47.600><c> make</c><00:14:47.720><c> sure</c><00:14:47.899><c> that</c><00:14:48.110><c> things</c><00:14:48.290><c> were</c><00:14:48.470><c> we</c><00:14:49.220><c> were</c>

00:14:49.329 --> 00:14:49.339 align:start position:0%
and make sure that things were we were
 

00:14:49.339 --> 00:14:50.889 align:start position:0%

00:14:50.889 --> 00:14:50.899 align:start position:0%
tracking where Beatty was and we had
 

00:14:50.899 --> 00:14:52.660 align:start position:0%
tracking where Beatty was and we had
like<00:14:51.079><c> a</c><00:14:51.220><c> location</c><00:14:52.220><c> for</c><00:14:52.370><c> the</c><00:14:52.459><c> head</c><00:14:52.639><c> and</c>

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:52.670 align:start position:0%
like a location for the head and
 

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
like a location for the head and

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:55.730 align:start position:0%

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.249 align:start position:0%
location for the guitar so this sort of
most<00:14:55.910><c> like</c><00:14:56.029><c> a</c><00:14:56.059><c> stage</c><00:14:56.420><c> like</c><00:14:56.720><c> it</c><00:14:56.749><c> was</c><00:14:56.929><c> very</c><00:14:57.110><c> much</c>

00:14:57.249 --> 00:14:57.259 align:start position:0%
most like a stage like it was very much
 

00:14:57.259 --> 00:14:58.960 align:start position:0%

like a theater stage in a way where we
 

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.900 align:start position:0%
like a theater stage in a way where we
had<00:14:59.179><c> kind</c><00:14:59.809><c> of</c><00:14:59.899><c> relaying</c><00:15:00.339><c> objects</c><00:15:01.339><c> and</c><00:15:01.490><c> scene</c>

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:01.910 align:start position:0%
had kind of relaying objects and scene
 

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.980 align:start position:0%
had kind of relaying objects and scene

scene elements out and in the space and
 

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:07.299 align:start position:0%
scene elements out and in the space and
then<00:15:06.170><c> finally</c><00:15:06.619><c> you</c><00:15:06.740><c> know</c><00:15:06.769><c> we</c><00:15:06.980><c> would</c><00:15:07.069><c> do</c><00:15:07.189><c> these</c>

00:15:07.299 --> 00:15:07.309 align:start position:0%
then finally you know we would do these
 

00:15:07.309 --> 00:15:09.309 align:start position:0%
then finally you know we would do these
kind<00:15:07.790><c> of</c><00:15:07.850><c> dress</c><00:15:08.059><c> rehearsals</c><00:15:08.600><c> with</c><00:15:08.689><c> Btu</c><00:15:09.110><c> and</c>

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:17.300 align:start position:0%
you know so that was kind of you know
 

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
you know so that was kind of you know
took<00:15:17.360><c> a</c><00:15:17.779><c> bit</c><00:15:17.899><c> of</c><00:15:17.990><c> practice</c><00:15:18.459><c> and</c><00:15:19.459><c> then</c><00:15:20.450><c> finally</c>

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:20.930 align:start position:0%
took a bit of practice and then finally
 

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
took a bit of practice and then finally
it<00:15:21.050><c> was</c><00:15:21.110><c> time</c><00:15:21.170><c> for</c><00:15:21.380><c> the</c><00:15:21.560><c> performance</c><00:15:22.070><c> and</c>

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:22.390 align:start position:0%
it was time for the performance and
 

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:24.670 align:start position:0%
it was time for the performance and
Beatty<00:15:23.390><c> would</c><00:15:23.630><c> start</c><00:15:23.930><c> off</c><00:15:24.050><c> in</c><00:15:24.170><c> the</c><00:15:24.260><c> other</c><00:15:24.380><c> room</c>

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:24.680 align:start position:0%
Beatty would start off in the other room
 

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.410 align:start position:0%
Beatty would start off in the other room
can<00:15:25.070><c> it</c><00:15:25.160><c> be</c><00:15:25.250><c> introduced</c><00:15:25.730><c> and</c><00:15:26.000><c> she</c><00:15:26.120><c> would</c><00:15:26.240><c> walk</c>

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:26.420 align:start position:0%
can it be introduced and she would walk
 

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
can it be introduced and she would walk

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:06.410 align:start position:0%

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:08.350 align:start position:0%
the other and so we were trying to kind

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
of line it up it was easier to do that
 

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
of line it up it was easier to do that
than<00:16:08.600><c> to</c><00:16:08.630><c> sort</c><00:16:08.930><c> of</c><00:16:08.990><c> find</c><00:16:09.260><c> some</c><00:16:09.730><c> algorithmic</c>

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:10.730 align:start position:0%
than to sort of find some algorithmic
 

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:14.470 align:start position:0%
than to sort of find some algorithmic
way<00:16:11.000><c> to</c><00:16:11.060><c> do</c><00:16:11.360><c> it</c><00:16:11.950><c> so</c><00:16:12.950><c> yeah</c><00:16:13.339><c> finally</c><00:16:13.670><c> that</c><00:16:13.970><c> we</c><00:16:14.149><c> had</c>

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
way to do it so yeah finally that we had
 

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
way to do it so yeah finally that we had
