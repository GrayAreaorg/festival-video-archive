her<00:07:55.650><c> head</c><00:07:55.800><c> I</c><00:07:55.860><c> would</c><00:07:56.099><c> scan</c><00:07:56.310><c> her</c><00:07:56.460><c> once</c><00:07:56.699><c> and</c><00:07:57.060><c> then</c>

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:57.150 align:start position:0%
her head I would scan her once and then
 

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.409 align:start position:0%
her head I would scan her once and then
she<00:07:57.180><c> turn</c><00:07:57.630><c> and</c><00:07:57.810><c> I'd</c><00:07:57.900><c> scan</c><00:07:58.139><c> her</c><00:07:58.380><c> a</c><00:07:58.409><c> third</c><00:07:58.740><c> time</c>

00:07:59.409 --> 00:07:59.419 align:start position:0%
