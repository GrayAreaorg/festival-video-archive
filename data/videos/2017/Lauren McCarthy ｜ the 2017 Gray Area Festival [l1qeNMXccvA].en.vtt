there<00:27:39.400><c> are</c><00:27:39.490><c> things</c><00:27:39.610><c> like</c><00:27:39.760><c> it</c><00:27:40.150><c> would</c><00:27:40.270><c> look</c><00:27:40.420><c> for</c>

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:40.690 align:start position:0%
there are things like it would look for
 

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
there are things like it would look for
the<00:27:40.720><c> phrase</c><00:27:40.930><c> we</c><00:27:41.200><c> should</c><00:27:41.470><c> and</c><00:27:41.680><c> it</c><00:27:41.770><c> would</c><00:27:41.860><c> just</c>

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:42.010 align:start position:0%
the phrase we should and it would just
 

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:45.530 align:start position:0%
the phrase we should and it would just
automatically<00:27:42.550><c> reply</c><00:27:42.970><c> yeah</c>

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
automatically reply yeah
 

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
automatically reply yeah

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
or<00:27:49.210><c> if</c><00:27:49.420><c> I</c><00:27:49.510><c> wrote</c><00:27:49.810><c> hi</c><00:27:50.080><c> it</c><00:27:50.620><c> would</c><00:27:50.830><c> respond</c><00:27:51.190><c> how's</c>

or if I wrote hi it would respond how's
 

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:54.620 align:start position:0%
or if I wrote hi it would respond how's
it<00:27:51.520><c> going</c><00:27:51.760><c> I've</c><00:27:51.850><c> been</c><00:27:51.880><c> thinking</c><00:27:52.300><c> about</c><00:27:52.360><c> you</c>

it going I've been thinking about you
and<00:27:55.630><c> then</c><00:27:55.900><c> on</c><00:27:56.020><c> my</c><00:27:56.230><c> end</c><00:27:56.410><c> I</c><00:27:56.590><c> would</c><00:27:56.650><c> just</c><00:27:56.890><c> try</c><00:27:57.040><c> I</c>

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:57.070 align:start position:0%
and then on my end I would just try I
 

00:27:57.070 --> 00:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
and then on my end I would just try I
was<00:27:57.340><c> trying</c><00:27:57.580><c> to</c><00:27:57.640><c> be</c><00:27:57.760><c> more</c><00:27:57.910><c> positive</c><00:27:58.180><c> so</c><00:27:58.690><c> it</c>

00:27:59.400 --> 00:27:59.410 align:start position:0%
was trying to be more positive so it
 

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:01.050 align:start position:0%
was trying to be more positive so it
would<00:27:59.560><c> replace</c><00:27:59.800><c> anything</c><00:28:00.430><c> I've</c><00:28:00.550><c> sent</c><00:28:00.820><c> that's</c>

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:01.060 align:start position:0%
would replace anything I've sent that's
 

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.450 align:start position:0%
would replace anything I've sent that's
it<00:28:01.240><c> I</c><00:28:01.330><c> don't</c><00:28:01.540><c> know</c><00:28:01.660><c> -</c><00:28:01.720><c> okay</c><00:28:02.110><c> I</c><00:28:02.590><c> would</c><00:28:03.100><c> replace</c>

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:03.460 align:start position:0%

space or a frowny face it would remove
 

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:20.910 align:start position:0%
space or a frowny face it would remove
completely<00:28:16.740><c> and</c><00:28:18.360><c> yeah</c><00:28:19.360><c> so</c><00:28:19.690><c> that</c><00:28:20.050><c> that</c><00:28:20.470><c> helped</c>

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
completely and yeah so that that helped
 

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
completely and yeah so that that helped
um<00:28:24.180><c> but</c><00:28:25.180><c> there's</c><00:28:25.360><c> this</c><00:28:25.510><c> other</c><00:28:25.660><c> problem</c><00:28:25.960><c> once</c>

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:26.710 align:start position:0%
um but there's this other problem once
 

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:28.890 align:start position:0%
um but there's this other problem once
you<00:28:26.770><c> solve</c><00:28:27.010><c> this</c><00:28:27.130><c> one</c><00:28:27.340><c> which</c><00:28:27.460><c> is</c><00:28:27.490><c> that</c><00:28:27.760><c> um</c><00:28:28.030><c> so</c><00:28:28.840><c> I</c>

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:28.900 align:start position:0%
you solve this one which is that um so I
 

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:31.950 align:start position:0%
you solve this one which is that um so I
was<00:28:29.110><c> around</c><00:28:30.100><c> 28</c><00:28:30.700><c> and</c><00:28:30.940><c> something</c><00:28:31.240><c> I</c><00:28:31.300><c> found</c><00:28:31.660><c> this</c>

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:34.150 align:start position:0%
this thing that happened which is I
 

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:35.310 align:start position:0%
this thing that happened which is I

was that like our male partners were not

having that experience very much and
 

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
having that experience very much and

having trouble understanding ours and so
 

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:05.730 align:start position:0%
having trouble understanding ours and so
I<00:29:02.350><c> devised</c><00:29:03.070><c> this</c><00:29:03.280><c> browser</c><00:29:03.550><c> extension</c><00:29:04.530><c> and</c><00:29:05.530><c> I</c>

00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:05.740 align:start position:0%
I devised this browser extension and I
 

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
I devised this browser extension and I
thought<00:29:05.950><c> you</c><00:29:06.250><c> know</c><00:29:06.340><c> Google</c><00:29:06.790><c> and</c><00:29:06.910><c> Facebook</c><00:29:07.000><c> can</c>

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:07.870 align:start position:0%
thought you know Google and Facebook can
 

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:10.770 align:start position:0%
thought you know Google and Facebook can
control<00:29:08.380><c> you</c><00:29:08.620><c> see</c><00:29:08.830><c> and</c><00:29:08.980><c> think</c><00:29:09.220><c> why</c><00:29:09.340><c> can't</c><00:29:09.670><c> I</c>

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:10.780 align:start position:0%
control you see and think why can't I
 

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
control you see and think why can't I
so<00:29:11.020><c> working</c><00:29:11.200><c> with</c><00:29:11.380><c> Charlotte</c><00:29:11.740><c> Styles</c><00:29:12.450><c> we</c>

so working with Charlotte Styles we
 

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:15.270 align:start position:0%
so working with Charlotte Styles we
