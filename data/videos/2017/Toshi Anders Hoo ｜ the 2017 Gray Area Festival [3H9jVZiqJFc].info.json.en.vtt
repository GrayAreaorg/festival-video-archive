00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 align:start position:0%
do some product shots so we had we
 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
do some product shots so we had we

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 align:start position:0%
started getting a little more serious
 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.610 align:start position:0%
started getting a little more serious

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 align:start position:0%

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 align:start position:0%
here's the result of it I'm going to
 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
here's the result of it I'm going to
talk<00:04:01.930><c> over</c><00:04:02.260><c> it</c><00:04:02.290><c> there's</c><00:04:02.620><c> a</c><00:04:02.680><c> lot</c><00:04:02.830><c> going</c><00:04:03.520><c> on</c><00:04:03.640><c> but</c>

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.220 align:start position:0%

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 align:start position:0%
basically what you're about to see is
 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.740 align:start position:0%
basically what you're about to see is
stop-motion<00:04:11.230><c> animation</c><00:04:11.530><c> and</c><00:04:12.360><c> we</c><00:04:13.360><c> used</c><00:04:13.600><c> a</c>

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 align:start position:0%
stop-motion animation and we used a
 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
stop-motion animation and we used a

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 align:start position:0%
robotic camera rail system so it's
 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
robotic camera rail system so it's
actually<00:04:16.510><c> a</c><00:04:16.690><c> performance</c><00:04:16.989><c> for</c><00:04:17.320><c> photographic</c>

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 align:start position:0%
actually a performance for photographic

actually a performance for photographic

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
performance piece because we have eight

to<00:05:28.850><c> do</c><00:05:28.970><c> more</c><00:05:29.000><c> prototyping</c><00:05:29.590><c> it's</c><00:05:30.590><c> also</c><00:05:30.710><c> really</c>

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 align:start position:0%
to do more prototyping it's also really
