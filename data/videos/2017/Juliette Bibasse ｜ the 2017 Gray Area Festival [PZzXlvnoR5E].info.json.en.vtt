00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
and you can see a lot of similarities
 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
and you can see a lot of similarities
with<00:01:13.350><c> this</c><00:01:13.799><c> picture</c><00:01:14.189><c> and</c><00:01:14.369><c> the</c><00:01:14.549><c> one</c><00:01:14.700><c> Joanie</c>

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.990 align:start position:0%
with this picture and the one Joanie
showed<00:01:16.009><c> so</c><00:01:17.009><c> I</c><00:01:17.040><c> guess</c><00:01:17.310><c> I</c><00:01:17.580><c> have</c><00:01:17.700><c> a</c><00:01:17.759><c> lot</c><00:01:17.880><c> of</c>

that we have a computer in Moscow and
 

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:15.059 align:start position:0%
that we have a computer in Moscow and

and we need it back with the power plug
 

00:15:15.069 --> 00:15:19.660 align:start position:0%
and we need it back with the power plug
so<00:15:16.069><c> as</c><00:15:16.189><c> I</c><00:15:16.279><c> said</c><00:15:17.290><c> maybe</c><00:15:18.290><c> a</c><00:15:18.439><c> sound</c><00:15:18.860><c> like</c><00:15:19.459><c> I</c><00:15:19.490><c> know</c>

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:19.670 align:start position:0%
so as I said maybe a sound like I know
 

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
so as I said maybe a sound like I know
what<00:15:19.850><c> I'm</c><00:15:20.149><c> doing</c><00:15:20.509><c> but</c><00:15:20.540><c> it's</c><00:15:21.019><c> always</c><00:15:21.829><c> different</c>

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:22.610 align:start position:0%
what I'm doing but it's always different
 

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
what I'm doing but it's always different
so<00:15:24.399><c> there</c><00:15:25.399><c> is</c><00:15:25.519><c> a</c><00:15:25.550><c> lot</c><00:15:25.790><c> of</c><00:15:25.939><c> improvisation</c><00:15:26.629><c> I</c>

00:15:27.519 --> 00:15:27.529 align:start position:0%
so there is a lot of improvisation I
 

00:15:27.529 --> 00:15:31.240 align:start position:0%
so there is a lot of improvisation I
guess<00:15:28.750><c> but</c><00:15:29.750><c> at</c><00:15:29.930><c> the</c><00:15:30.079><c> end</c><00:15:30.110><c> it's</c><00:15:30.769><c> really</c><00:15:31.040><c> worth</c>

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:31.250 align:start position:0%
guess but at the end it's really worth
 

00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:37.660 align:start position:0%
guess but at the end it's really worth
it<00:15:32.740><c> so</c><00:15:33.740><c> this</c><00:15:34.279><c> is</c><00:15:34.459><c> me</c><00:15:34.639><c> in</c><00:15:34.970><c> front</c><00:15:35.779><c> of</c><00:15:36.189><c> things</c><00:15:37.189><c> I</c>
