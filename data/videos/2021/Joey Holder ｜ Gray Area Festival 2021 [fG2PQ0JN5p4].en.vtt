00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.950 align:start position:0%
um with this project and so a lot of my
work<00:07:58.680><c> yeah</c><00:07:58.979><c> kind</c><00:07:59.400><c> of</c><00:07:59.520><c> like</c><00:07:59.819><c> grapples</c><00:08:00.419><c> with</c>

there's the Earth Bank of codes
um<00:13:42.300><c> I</c><00:13:42.420><c> think</c><00:13:42.600><c> it's</c><00:13:42.720><c> called</c><00:13:42.959><c> which</c><00:13:43.320><c> is</c><00:13:43.440><c> another</c>

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
um I think it's called which is another
 

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.009 align:start position:0%
um I think it's called which is another

um<00:13:52.380><c> I</c><00:13:52.680><c> mean</c><00:13:52.800><c> and</c><00:13:52.920><c> again</c><00:13:53.220><c> like</c><00:13:53.639><c> there's</c><00:13:54.300><c> there's</c>

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:54.660 align:start position:0%
um I mean and again like there's there's
 

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.530 align:start position:0%
um I mean and again like there's there's
so<00:13:54.959><c> many</c><00:13:55.139><c> species</c><00:13:56.040><c> on</c><00:13:56.279><c> Earth</c><00:13:56.459><c> that</c><00:13:56.940><c> are</c>

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
so many species on Earth that are
 

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.210 align:start position:0%
so many species on Earth that are

00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
sea for example is this hugely like
 

00:14:03.959 --> 00:14:06.829 align:start position:0%
sea for example is this hugely like

um yeah manipulated through like
 

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.630 align:start position:0%
um yeah manipulated through like
algorithmic<00:18:56.640><c> processes</c><00:18:57.360><c> and</c><00:18:57.780><c> manipulation</c>

00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
algorithmic processes and manipulation
 

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.430 align:start position:0%
algorithmic processes and manipulation
uh<00:18:59.640><c> and</c><00:18:59.880><c> control</c>

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh and control
 

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:05.029 align:start position:0%
uh and control
and<00:19:02.220><c> so</c><00:19:02.880><c> I</c><00:19:03.419><c> made</c><00:19:03.660><c> a</c><00:19:04.020><c> project</c><00:19:04.200><c> that</c><00:19:04.679><c> was</c><00:19:04.799><c> all</c>

00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
and so I made a project that was all
 

00:19:05.039 --> 00:19:05.990 align:start position:0%
and so I made a project that was all
about

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
about
 

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.970 align:start position:0%

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
um as I say like the construction of
 

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.390 align:start position:0%
um as I say like the construction of
belief<00:19:08.760><c> in</c><00:19:09.480><c> online</c><00:19:09.660><c> networks</c>

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%

um<00:19:11.520><c> and</c><00:19:12.000><c> it</c><00:19:12.299><c> had</c><00:19:12.419><c> like</c><00:19:12.720><c> a</c><00:19:12.900><c> large</c><00:19:13.080><c> scale</c>

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
um and it had like a large scale
 

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.510 align:start position:0%
um and it had like a large scale
um<00:19:14.400><c> installation</c><00:19:15.120><c> and</c>

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%

um there's sort of like a lake at the
bottom<00:37:05.579><c> of</c><00:37:05.760><c> the</c><00:37:06.000><c> ocean</c><00:37:06.200><c> so</c><00:37:07.200><c> it</c><00:37:07.619><c> looks</c><00:37:07.920><c> like</c><00:37:08.040><c> a</c>

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
bottom of the ocean so it looks like a
 

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.890 align:start position:0%
bottom of the ocean so it looks like a
lake<00:37:08.400><c> when</c><00:37:08.700><c> you</c><00:37:08.820><c> when</c><00:37:09.060><c> you</c><00:37:09.240><c> look</c><00:37:09.359><c> at</c><00:37:09.540><c> it</c><00:37:09.660><c> but</c>

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
lake when you when you look at it but
 

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:11.690 align:start position:0%
lake when you when you look at it but
it's<00:37:10.020><c> just</c><00:37:10.260><c> that</c><00:37:10.440><c> the</c><00:37:10.680><c> water</c><00:37:10.859><c> is</c><00:37:11.220><c> like</c><00:37:11.400><c> a</c><00:37:11.579><c> lot</c>

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
it's just that the water is like a lot
 

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:15.050 align:start position:0%
it's just that the water is like a lot
more<00:37:12.140><c> saline</c><00:37:13.140><c> and</c><00:37:13.440><c> salty</c><00:37:13.920><c> so</c><00:37:14.460><c> it</c><00:37:14.640><c> looks</c><00:37:14.940><c> like</c>

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
more saline and salty so it looks like
 

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.030 align:start position:0%
more saline and salty so it looks like
there's<00:37:15.359><c> a</c><00:37:15.540><c> kind</c><00:37:15.660><c> of</c><00:37:15.780><c> like</c><00:37:15.900><c> lake</c><00:37:16.320><c> at</c><00:37:16.920><c> the</c>

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
there's a kind of like lake at the
 

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.790 align:start position:0%
there's a kind of like lake at the

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:41.450 align:start position:0%
stay in there too long
um<00:37:39.180><c> but</c><00:37:39.599><c> I</c><00:37:39.720><c> kind</c><00:37:39.900><c> of</c><00:37:40.020><c> thought</c><00:37:40.200><c> about</c><00:37:40.440><c> this</c><00:37:40.980><c> this</c>

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
um but I kind of thought about this this
 

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.510 align:start position:0%
um but I kind of thought about this this
kind<00:37:41.760><c> of</c><00:37:41.940><c> place</c><00:37:42.359><c> as</c>

00:37:44.510 --> 00:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
kind of place as
 

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.790 align:start position:0%
kind of place as
a<00:37:45.000><c> place</c><00:37:45.180><c> that's</c><00:37:45.480><c> like</c><00:37:45.780><c> completely</c><00:37:46.440><c> like</c>

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
a place that's like completely like
 

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.670 align:start position:0%
a place that's like completely like
beyond<00:37:47.339><c> our</c><00:37:47.820><c> understanding</c><00:37:48.420><c> really</c><00:37:48.780><c> and</c><00:37:49.440><c> I</c>

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
beyond our understanding really and I
 

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.010 align:start position:0%
beyond our understanding really and I
mean<00:37:49.800><c> it's</c><00:37:49.980><c> a</c><00:37:50.220><c> well-known</c><00:37:50.700><c> metaphor</c><00:37:51.599><c> I</c><00:37:51.839><c> guess</c>

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
mean it's a well-known metaphor I guess
 

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.349 align:start position:0%
mean it's a well-known metaphor I guess
that<00:37:52.380><c> you</c><00:37:52.619><c> know</c><00:37:52.680><c> we</c><00:37:52.859><c> know</c><00:37:53.160><c> more</c><00:37:53.400><c> about</c><00:37:53.579><c> outer</c>

00:37:54.349 --> 00:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
that you know we know more about outer
 

00:37:54.359 --> 00:37:57.109 align:start position:0%
that you know we know more about outer

00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
space Maybe than we know then that's
 

00:37:57.119 --> 00:37:59.930 align:start position:0%
space Maybe than we know then that's
what's<00:37:57.359><c> at</c><00:37:57.599><c> the</c><00:37:57.780><c> bottom</c><00:37:58.020><c> of</c><00:37:58.200><c> the</c><00:37:58.380><c> the</c><00:37:58.619><c> ocean</c>

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
as well I mean for example like we used
 

00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:26.150 align:start position:0%
as well I mean for example like we used
to<00:38:23.339><c> think</c><00:38:23.579><c> that</c><00:38:23.940><c> everything</c><00:38:24.180><c> needed</c><00:38:24.780><c> to</c>

um<00:50:57.720><c> I</c><00:50:58.200><c> actually</c><00:50:58.319><c> wasn't</c><00:50:58.680><c> successful</c><00:50:59.339><c> in</c><00:50:59.880><c> fun</c>

um I actually wasn't successful in fun
 

00:51:00.059 --> 00:51:02.210 align:start position:0%
um I actually wasn't successful in fun
getting<00:51:00.420><c> funding</c><00:51:00.960><c> for</c><00:51:01.200><c> it</c><00:51:01.319><c> I</c><00:51:01.559><c> just</c><00:51:01.740><c> found</c><00:51:01.980><c> out</c>

00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:02.220 align:start position:0%
getting funding for it I just found out
 

00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:04.069 align:start position:0%
getting funding for it I just found out
that<00:51:02.400><c> I</c><00:51:02.520><c> couldn't</c><00:51:02.640><c> get</c><00:51:02.880><c> funding</c><00:51:03.359><c> but</c><00:51:03.660><c> I</c><00:51:03.960><c> think</c>

00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
that I couldn't get funding but I think
 

00:51:04.079 --> 00:51:07.490 align:start position:0%
that I couldn't get funding but I think
like<00:51:04.440><c> the</c><00:51:05.040><c> project</c><00:51:05.220><c> also</c><00:51:05.819><c> probably</c><00:51:06.000><c> needs</c><00:51:06.599><c> to</c>

00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
like the project also probably needs to
 

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:10.010 align:start position:0%
like the project also probably needs to
adapt<00:51:08.280><c> as</c><00:51:08.520><c> well</c><00:51:08.700><c> because</c><00:51:08.880><c> it</c><00:51:09.059><c> was</c><00:51:09.300><c> very</c><00:51:09.540><c> much</c><00:51:09.780><c> a</c>

00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
adapt as well because it was very much a
 

00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:11.750 align:start position:0%
adapt as well because it was very much a
response<00:51:10.500><c> to</c><00:51:10.740><c> what</c><00:51:10.920><c> was</c><00:51:11.040><c> happening</c><00:51:11.400><c> at</c><00:51:11.640><c> the</c>

00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:17.420 align:start position:0%
perhaps it needs to now yeah
 

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:20.990 align:start position:0%
