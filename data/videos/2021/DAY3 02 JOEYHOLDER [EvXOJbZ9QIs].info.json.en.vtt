that we haven't discovered the deep sea
for<00:13:56.720><c> example</c><00:13:57.279><c> is</c><00:13:57.440><c> this</c><00:13:57.839><c> hugely</c><00:13:58.480><c> like</c>

00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
for example is this hugely like
 

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.590 align:start position:0%
for example is this hugely like

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
and you know like the ceiling was like
 

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.590 align:start position:0%
and you know like the ceiling was like
starting<00:25:52.000><c> to</c><00:25:52.159><c> leak</c><00:25:52.480><c> and</c><00:25:52.640><c> stuff</c><00:25:52.960><c> like</c><00:25:53.120><c> that</c><00:25:53.440><c> and</c>

i basically
split<00:36:17.040><c> up</c><00:36:17.359><c> the</c><00:36:17.520><c> project</c><00:36:18.160><c> into</c><00:36:18.640><c> these</c>

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
split up the project into these
 

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.109 align:start position:0%
split up the project into these
different<00:36:19.440><c> zones</c><00:36:20.000><c> which</c><00:36:20.240><c> was</c><00:36:20.480><c> meant</c><00:36:20.720><c> to</c>

00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
different zones which was meant to
 

00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:24.310 align:start position:0%
different zones which was meant to
represent<00:36:21.920><c> different</c><00:36:22.640><c> zones</c><00:36:23.200><c> of</c><00:36:23.359><c> the</c><00:36:24.079><c> of</c><00:36:24.160><c> the</c>

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
represent different zones of the of the
 

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:27.270 align:start position:0%
represent different zones of the of the
deep<00:36:24.640><c> sea</c><00:36:25.359><c> um</c><00:36:25.920><c> actually</c><00:36:26.320><c> and</c><00:36:26.640><c> like</c><00:36:26.800><c> the</c><00:36:26.960><c> open</c>

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
deep sea um actually and like the open
 

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.630 align:start position:0%
deep sea um actually and like the open
water<00:36:27.680><c> as</c><00:36:27.839><c> well</c>

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
water as well
 

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:30.390 align:start position:0%
water as well
um<00:36:29.280><c> and</c>

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
um and
 

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:33.190 align:start position:0%
um and
yeah<00:36:30.720><c> so</c><00:36:30.960><c> each</c><00:36:31.200><c> of</c><00:36:31.280><c> the</c><00:36:31.440><c> zones</c><00:36:32.240><c> like</c><00:36:32.800><c> i</c><00:36:32.960><c> guess</c>

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so each of the zones like i guess
 

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:33.910 align:start position:0%
yeah so each of the zones like i guess
is

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
is
 

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.310 align:start position:0%
is
meant<00:36:34.079><c> to</c><00:36:34.240><c> represent</c><00:36:34.800><c> like</c><00:36:35.200><c> different</c>

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
meant to represent like different
 

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.510 align:start position:0%
meant to represent like different
um

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
um
 

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.510 align:start position:0%
um
yeah<00:36:37.839><c> ecosystems</c><00:36:38.640><c> within</c><00:36:38.960><c> these</c><00:36:39.119><c> different</c>

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
yeah ecosystems within these different
 

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:43.670 align:start position:0%
yeah ecosystems within these different
like<00:36:39.760><c> places</c><00:36:40.720><c> um</c><00:36:41.040><c> but</c><00:36:41.200><c> the</c><00:36:41.359><c> focus</c><00:36:42.160><c> is</c><00:36:42.400><c> on</c>

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
like places um but the focus is on
 

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.910 align:start position:0%
like places um but the focus is on
yeah<00:36:43.920><c> this</c><00:36:44.160><c> kind</c><00:36:44.400><c> of</c><00:36:44.480><c> like</c><00:36:44.800><c> abyssal</c>

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
yeah this kind of like abyssal
 

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.870 align:start position:0%
yeah this kind of like abyssal
zone<00:36:46.720><c> which</c><00:36:47.520><c> like</c><00:36:47.760><c> was</c><00:36:48.000><c> actually</c>

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
zone which like was actually
 

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.109 align:start position:0%
zone which like was actually
it's<00:36:49.040><c> quite</c><00:36:49.280><c> cheesy</c><00:36:49.680><c> but</c><00:36:49.839><c> it</c><00:36:49.920><c> was</c><00:36:50.160><c> inspired</c><00:36:50.800><c> by</c>

00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
it's quite cheesy but it was inspired by
 

00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:54.150 align:start position:0%
it's quite cheesy but it was inspired by
like<00:36:51.760><c> watching</c><00:36:52.400><c> a</c><00:36:52.800><c> blue</c><00:36:53.119><c> planet</c><00:36:53.520><c> episode</c>

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
like watching a blue planet episode
 

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:57.109 align:start position:0%
like watching a blue planet episode
actually<00:36:54.640><c> where</c><00:36:55.280><c> there's</c><00:36:56.079><c> a</c>

00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
actually where there's a
 

00:36:57.119 --> 00:36:59.990 align:start position:0%
actually where there's a
um<00:36:58.000><c> there's</c><00:36:58.240><c> sort</c><00:36:58.400><c> of</c><00:36:58.560><c> like</c><00:36:58.800><c> a</c><00:36:59.040><c> lake</c><00:36:59.680><c> at</c><00:36:59.920><c> the</c>

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
um there's sort of like a lake at the
 

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.030 align:start position:0%
um there's sort of like a lake at the
bottom<00:37:00.400><c> of</c><00:37:00.560><c> the</c><00:37:00.720><c> ocean</c><00:37:01.599><c> so</c><00:37:02.160><c> it</c><00:37:02.400><c> looks</c><00:37:02.720><c> like</c><00:37:02.960><c> a</c>

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
bottom of the ocean so it looks like a
 

00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:04.710 align:start position:0%
bottom of the ocean so it looks like a
lake<00:37:03.359><c> when</c><00:37:03.520><c> you</c><00:37:03.760><c> when</c><00:37:03.920><c> you</c><00:37:04.079><c> look</c><00:37:04.240><c> at</c><00:37:04.400><c> it</c><00:37:04.560><c> but</c>

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
lake when you when you look at it but
 

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.470 align:start position:0%
lake when you when you look at it but
it's<00:37:04.880><c> just</c><00:37:05.040><c> that</c><00:37:05.200><c> the</c><00:37:05.359><c> water</c><00:37:05.920><c> is</c><00:37:06.000><c> like</c><00:37:06.240><c> a</c><00:37:06.320><c> lot</c>

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's just that the water is like a lot
 

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.430 align:start position:0%
it's just that the water is like a lot
more

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
more
 

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.910 align:start position:0%
more
saline<00:37:08.079><c> and</c><00:37:08.240><c> salty</c><00:37:09.040><c> so</c><00:37:09.280><c> it</c><00:37:09.440><c> looks</c><00:37:09.680><c> like</c>

00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
saline and salty so it looks like
 

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:11.750 align:start position:0%
saline and salty so it looks like
there's<00:37:10.160><c> a</c><00:37:10.240><c> kind</c><00:37:10.400><c> of</c><00:37:10.560><c> like</c><00:37:10.800><c> lake</c><00:37:11.520><c> at</c><00:37:11.680><c> the</c>

i<00:37:34.480><c> kind</c><00:37:34.640><c> of</c><00:37:34.800><c> thought</c><00:37:35.040><c> about</c><00:37:35.359><c> this</c><00:37:36.079><c> this</c><00:37:36.320><c> kind</c>

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
i kind of thought about this this kind
 

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.589 align:start position:0%
i kind of thought about this this kind
of<00:37:36.800><c> place</c><00:37:37.520><c> as</c>

00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
of place as
 

00:37:39.599 --> 00:37:41.670 align:start position:0%

a place that's like completely like
beyond<00:37:42.400><c> our</c><00:37:42.640><c> understanding</c><00:37:43.359><c> really</c><00:37:43.920><c> um</c><00:37:44.320><c> i</c>

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
beyond our understanding really um i
 

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.950 align:start position:0%
beyond our understanding really um i
mean<00:37:44.640><c> it's</c><00:37:44.800><c> a</c><00:37:44.880><c> well-known</c><00:37:45.839><c> metaphor</c><00:37:46.480><c> i</c><00:37:46.560><c> guess</c>

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
mean it's a well-known metaphor i guess
 

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.109 align:start position:0%
mean it's a well-known metaphor i guess
that<00:37:47.200><c> you</c><00:37:47.359><c> know</c><00:37:47.520><c> we</c><00:37:47.760><c> know</c><00:37:48.000><c> more</c><00:37:48.240><c> about</c><00:37:48.800><c> outer</c>

00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
that you know we know more about outer
 

00:37:49.119 --> 00:37:51.510 align:start position:0%
that you know we know more about outer
space<00:37:49.520><c> maybe</c><00:37:50.079><c> than</c><00:37:50.320><c> we</c><00:37:50.480><c> know</c>

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
space maybe than we know
