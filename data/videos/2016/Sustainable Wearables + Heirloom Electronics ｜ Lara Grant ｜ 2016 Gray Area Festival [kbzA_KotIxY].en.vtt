00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 align:start position:0%
where we may want to go from here as we
 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.779 align:start position:0%
where we may want to go from here as we
push<00:00:55.800><c> fashion</c><00:00:56.550><c> and</c><00:00:56.699><c> electronics</c><00:00:57.180><c> to</c><00:00:57.270><c> merge</c>
