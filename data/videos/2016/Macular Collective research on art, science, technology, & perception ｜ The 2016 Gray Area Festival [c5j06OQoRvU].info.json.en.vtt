all the senses so it's about this
 

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.230 align:start position:0%
all the senses so it's about this
sensorial<00:07:46.560><c> experience</c><00:07:46.890><c> and</c><00:07:47.700><c> I</c><00:07:47.880><c> think</c><00:07:48.150><c> you</c>

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
sensorial experience and I think you
 

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.620 align:start position:0%
sensorial experience and I think you
also<00:07:48.390><c> noticed</c><00:07:48.930><c> this</c><00:07:49.050><c> in</c><00:07:49.110><c> the</c><00:07:49.350><c> exhibition</c>

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:50.630 align:start position:0%
also noticed this in the exhibition
 

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:54.860 align:start position:0%
also noticed this in the exhibition
maybe<00:07:51.630><c> the</c><00:07:51.840><c> dominant</c><00:07:52.260><c> one</c><00:07:52.290><c> is</c><00:07:52.710><c> vision</c><00:07:53.400><c> but</c><00:07:54.060><c> in</c>

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:54.870 align:start position:0%
maybe the dominant one is vision but in
 

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.710 align:start position:0%
maybe the dominant one is vision but in

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
this insulation like before you enter
 

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.810 align:start position:0%
this insulation like before you enter
the<00:07:57.840><c> space</c><00:07:58.050><c> you</c><00:07:58.260><c> will</c><00:07:58.410><c> smell</c><00:07:58.710><c> the</c><00:07:58.950><c> soap</c><00:07:59.160><c> so</c>

00:07:59.810 --> 00:07:59.820 align:start position:0%
the space you will smell the soap so
 

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.390 align:start position:0%
the space you will smell the soap so
also<00:08:00.000><c> I</c><00:08:00.480><c> try</c><00:08:00.660><c> to</c><00:08:00.900><c> approach</c><00:08:01.590><c> all</c><00:08:01.860><c> these</c><00:08:02.130><c> other</c>

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
also I try to approach all these other
 

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.180 align:start position:0%
also I try to approach all these other
senses<00:08:02.880><c> also</c><00:08:03.270><c> detect</c><00:08:03.750><c> I'll</c><00:08:03.930><c> sense</c><00:08:04.230><c> the</c>

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:05.190 align:start position:0%
senses also detect I'll sense the

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:07.020 align:start position:0%

that you brought with you jars um I can
talk<00:11:14.870><c> a</c><00:11:14.930><c> bit</c><00:11:15.170><c> about</c><00:11:15.200><c> the</c><00:11:15.680><c> revolt</c><00:11:16.520><c> piece</c><00:11:17.560><c> let</c><00:11:18.560><c> me</c>

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:18.650 align:start position:0%
talk a bit about the revolt piece let me
 

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:21.670 align:start position:0%
talk a bit about the revolt piece let me
just<00:11:19.270><c> see</c><00:11:20.270><c> where</c><00:11:20.450><c> it</c><00:11:20.480><c> is</c><00:11:20.690><c> or</c><00:11:20.930><c> not</c><00:11:20.990><c> maybe</c><00:11:21.350><c> maybe</c>

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
just see where it is or not maybe maybe
 

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
just see where it is or not maybe maybe
this<00:11:21.890><c> is</c><00:11:22.040><c> a</c><00:11:22.070><c> good</c><00:11:22.160><c> way</c><00:11:22.430><c> to</c><00:11:22.460><c> start</c><00:11:22.820><c> like</c><00:11:23.450><c> this</c><00:11:23.630><c> is</c>

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:23.810 align:start position:0%
this is a good way to start like this is
 

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
this is a good way to start like this is

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:32.060 align:start position:0%
see what it is it's a it's a kinetic
 

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.850 align:start position:0%
see what it is it's a it's a kinetic

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:48.230 align:start position:0%
birds so I was looking at these patterns
 

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
birds so I was looking at these patterns
and<00:11:48.680><c> I</c><00:11:48.770><c> wanted</c><00:11:49.130><c> to</c><00:11:49.280><c> capture</c><00:11:49.550><c> that</c><00:11:49.760><c> in</c><00:11:50.180><c> a</c>

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:50.590 align:start position:0%

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:58.210 align:start position:0%
mechanical sculpture so you see how they
move<00:11:55.070><c> and</c><00:11:55.130><c> they</c><00:11:56.860><c> there's</c><00:11:57.860><c> kind</c><00:11:58.100><c> of</c><00:11:58.160><c> this</c>

00:11:58.210 --> 00:11:58.220 align:start position:0%
move and they there's kind of this
 

00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.860 align:start position:0%
move and they there's kind of this

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.350 align:start position:0%
scientists would probably never do

it's<00:23:43.290><c> I</c><00:23:43.620><c> think</c><00:23:43.740><c> it's</c><00:23:44.070><c> difficult</c><00:23:44.520><c> to</c><00:23:44.670><c> create</c>

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:57.930 align:start position:0%
a good example you need time and money
 

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:00.290 align:start position:0%

that<00:23:58.350><c> both</c><00:23:58.650><c> parties</c><00:23:58.920><c> can</c><00:23:59.280><c> really</c><00:23:59.550><c> work</c><00:23:59.970><c> when</c>

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:00.300 align:start position:0%
that both parties can really work when

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
and and objects moving moving objects so
 

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.770 align:start position:0%
and and objects moving moving objects so
that<00:26:27.380><c> went</c><00:26:28.380><c> from</c><00:26:28.530><c> one</c><00:26:28.680><c> is</c><00:26:28.800><c> this</c><00:26:28.950><c> this</c><00:26:29.130><c> is</c><00:26:29.190><c> like</c>

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:29.780 align:start position:0%
that went from one is this this is like
 

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:32.660 align:start position:0%
that went from one is this this is like
36<00:26:30.780><c> 40</c><00:26:31.230><c> something</c><00:26:31.500><c> like</c><00:26:31.620><c> that</c><00:26:31.800><c> maybe</c><00:26:32.400><c> the</c>

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:32.670 align:start position:0%
36 40 something like that maybe the
 

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:36.230 align:start position:0%
36 40 something like that maybe the
video<00:26:33.270><c> says</c><00:26:33.570><c> it</c><00:26:34.310><c> yeah</c><00:26:35.310><c> i</c><00:26:35.340><c> think</c><00:26:35.490><c> this</c><00:26:35.730><c> this</c><00:26:36.090><c> is</c>

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
video says it yeah i think this this is
 

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:40.310 align:start position:0%
video says it yeah i think this this is
one<00:26:36.390><c> of</c><00:26:36.420><c> his</c><00:26:36.630><c> latest</c><00:26:36.900><c> yeah</c><00:26:37.860><c> so</c><00:26:38.160><c> 48</c><00:26:38.520><c> yeah</c><00:26:39.080><c> so</c><00:26:40.080><c> for</c>

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
one of his latest yeah so 48 yeah so for
 

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.390 align:start position:0%
one of his latest yeah so 48 yeah so for
me<00:26:40.410><c> that's</c><00:26:40.530><c> also</c><00:26:40.860><c> one</c><00:26:40.980><c> of</c><00:26:41.010><c> the</c><00:26:41.130><c> things</c><00:26:41.340><c> that</c>

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
me that's also one of the things that
 

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
me that's also one of the things that
I'm<00:26:41.550><c> really</c><00:26:41.580><c> interested</c><00:26:41.790><c> in</c><00:26:42.150><c> is</c><00:26:42.330><c> like</c><00:26:42.450><c> we</c><00:26:42.990><c> work</c>

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:43.530 align:start position:0%
I'm really interested in is like we work
 

00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:46.550 align:start position:0%
I'm really interested in is like we work
in<00:26:43.710><c> art</c><00:26:43.890><c> and</c><00:26:44.010><c> technology</c><00:26:44.610><c> um</c><00:26:44.880><c> and</c><00:26:45.600><c> there's</c><00:26:46.380><c> his</c>

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
in art and technology um and there's his
 

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.380 align:start position:0%
in art and technology um and there's his
idea<00:26:46.920><c> like</c><00:26:47.070><c> oh</c><00:26:47.190><c> we're</c><00:26:47.370><c> doing</c><00:26:47.520><c> the</c><00:26:47.790><c> newest</c>

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:48.390 align:start position:0%
idea like oh we're doing the newest
 

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.570 align:start position:0%
idea like oh we're doing the newest
latest<00:26:48.660><c> thing</c><00:26:49.140><c> but</c><00:26:49.470><c> actually</c><00:26:49.740><c> there's</c><00:26:50.490><c> a</c>

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
latest thing but actually there's a
 

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:52.610 align:start position:0%
latest thing but actually there's a
really<00:26:50.880><c> big</c><00:26:51.030><c> history</c><00:26:51.450><c> to</c><00:26:51.570><c> all</c><00:26:51.690><c> of</c><00:26:51.840><c> this</c><00:26:51.960><c> and</c><00:26:52.500><c> I</c>

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
really big history to all of this and I
 

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.170 align:start position:0%
really big history to all of this and I
think<00:26:52.830><c> it's</c><00:26:52.950><c> really</c><00:26:53.010><c> important</c><00:26:53.580><c> to</c><00:26:53.640><c> be</c><00:26:53.940><c> aware</c>

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:54.180 align:start position:0%
think it's really important to be aware
 

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:57.950 align:start position:0%
think it's really important to be aware
of<00:26:54.480><c> that</c><00:26:54.630><c> and</c><00:26:55.170><c> and</c><00:26:55.620><c> and</c><00:26:56.310><c> it's</c><00:26:57.030><c> also</c><00:26:57.120><c> a</c><00:26:57.240><c> lot</c><00:26:57.870><c> of</c>

00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
of that and and and it's also a lot of
 

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
of that and and and it's also a lot of
Forgotten<00:26:58.470><c> technology</c><00:26:59.130><c> yeah</c><00:26:59.340><c> that's</c><00:26:59.670><c> very</c>

00:26:59.960 --> 00:26:59.970 align:start position:0%
Forgotten technology yeah that's very
 

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:02.810 align:start position:0%
Forgotten technology yeah that's very
interesting<00:27:00.180><c> and</c><00:27:00.690><c> to</c><00:27:00.900><c> work</c><00:27:01.050><c> with</c><00:27:01.320><c> I</c><00:27:01.820><c> think</c>

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
interesting and to work with I think
 

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
interesting and to work with I think
also<00:27:03.090><c> going</c><00:27:03.390><c> back</c><00:27:03.750><c> to</c><00:27:03.960><c> to</c><00:27:04.260><c> these</c><00:27:04.440><c> pure</c><00:27:04.830><c> things</c>

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:05.130 align:start position:0%
also going back to to these pure things
 

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:07.180 align:start position:0%
also going back to to these pure things
like<00:27:05.310><c> huh</c><00:27:05.550><c> what</c><00:27:05.880><c> slide</c><00:27:06.150><c> how</c><00:27:06.510><c> is</c><00:27:06.570><c> it</c><00:27:06.660><c> working</c>

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:07.190 align:start position:0%
like huh what slide how is it working
 

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:10.640 align:start position:0%
like huh what slide how is it working
all<00:27:08.190><c> these</c><00:27:08.370><c> aspects</c><00:27:08.880><c> yeah</c><00:27:09.570><c> I</c><00:27:09.630><c> think</c><00:27:09.750><c> because</c><00:27:10.200><c> I</c>

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:10.650 align:start position:0%
all these aspects yeah I think because I
 

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:13.220 align:start position:0%
all these aspects yeah I think because I
like<00:27:11.640><c> it</c><00:27:11.790><c> that</c><00:27:11.820><c> is</c><00:27:12.060><c> that</c><00:27:12.690><c> you</c><00:27:12.810><c> can</c><00:27:12.990><c> work</c><00:27:13.200><c> with</c>

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:13.230 align:start position:0%
like it that is that you can work with
 

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:15.620 align:start position:0%
like it that is that you can work with
very<00:27:13.650><c> simple</c><00:27:13.980><c> elements</c><00:27:14.730><c> like</c><00:27:15.000><c> I</c><00:27:15.210><c> think</c><00:27:15.450><c> most</c>

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:15.630 align:start position:0%
very simple elements like I think most
 

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:16.940 align:start position:0%
very simple elements like I think most
of<00:27:15.750><c> these</c><00:27:15.930><c> work</c><00:27:16.170><c> could</c><00:27:16.410><c> it</c><00:27:16.530><c> could</c><00:27:16.680><c> have</c><00:27:16.800><c> also</c>

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:16.950 align:start position:0%
of these work could it could have also
 

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:21.590 align:start position:0%
of these work could it could have also
been<00:27:17.280><c> done</c><00:27:17.520><c> like</c><00:27:18.110><c> decades</c><00:27:19.110><c> ago</c><00:27:20.300><c> although</c><00:27:21.300><c> the</c>

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
been done like decades ago although the
 

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.330 align:start position:0%
been done like decades ago although the
Arduino<00:27:22.140><c> ever</c><00:27:22.440><c> ask</c><00:27:22.560><c> me</c><00:27:22.620><c> goodbye</c><00:27:22.830><c> makes</c><00:27:23.190><c> it</c>

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
Arduino ever ask me goodbye makes it
 

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.790 align:start position:0%
Arduino ever ask me goodbye makes it
easy<00:27:23.550><c> but</c><00:27:24.330><c> technically</c><00:27:24.720><c> it's</c><00:27:24.960><c> possible</c><00:27:25.470><c> to</c><00:27:25.680><c> do</c>

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
easy but technically it's possible to do
 

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.740 align:start position:0%
easy but technically it's possible to do
these<00:27:25.950><c> things</c><00:27:26.750><c> maybe</c><00:27:27.750><c> you</c><00:27:27.870><c> can</c><00:27:27.990><c> show</c><00:27:28.170><c> the</c>

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:29.750 align:start position:0%
these things maybe you can show the
 

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:35.510 align:start position:0%
these things maybe you can show the
Gordon<00:27:30.750><c> pass</c><00:27:30.900><c> quark</c>

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
 

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
that<00:27:36.520><c> this</c><00:27:36.790><c> one</c><00:27:38.640><c> so</c><00:27:39.640><c> it's</c><00:27:39.910><c> kind</c><00:27:40.210><c> of</c><00:27:40.240><c> hard</c><00:27:40.300><c> to</c>

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:40.570 align:start position:0%
that this one so it's kind of hard to
 

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
that this one so it's kind of hard to
find<00:27:40.900><c> good</c><00:27:41.050><c> footage</c><00:27:41.260><c> of</c><00:27:41.500><c> this</c><00:27:41.680><c> but</c><00:27:41.890><c> if</c><00:27:42.010><c> you</c>

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:42.370 align:start position:0%
find good footage of this but if you
 

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:46.250 align:start position:0%
find good footage of this but if you
scroll<00:27:43.090><c> down</c><00:27:43.300><c> all</c><00:27:43.330><c> the</c><00:27:43.600><c> way</c><00:27:43.720><c> or</c><00:27:44.470><c> far</c><00:27:45.370><c> far</c><00:27:45.820><c> far</c>

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
scroll down all the way or far far far
 

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.230 align:start position:0%
scroll down all the way or far far far
so<00:27:47.260><c> this</c><00:27:47.440><c> is</c><00:27:47.590><c> in</c><00:27:47.820><c> 1968</c><00:27:48.820><c> there</c><00:27:49.000><c> was</c><00:27:49.120><c> this</c>

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
so this is in 1968 there was this
 

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
so this is in 1968 there was this

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
piece by Gordon Gordon Pask and I only
found<00:28:05.350><c> out</c><00:28:05.560><c> about</c><00:28:05.620><c> it</c><00:28:05.920><c> recently</c><00:28:06.340><c> what</c><00:28:06.760><c> it</c>

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:06.850 align:start position:0%
found out about it recently what it
 

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:10.650 align:start position:0%
found out about it recently what it
really<00:28:06.940><c> does</c><00:28:08.250><c> because</c><00:28:09.250><c> it's</c><00:28:09.970><c> hard</c><00:28:10.300><c> to</c><00:28:10.480><c> find</c>

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:10.660 align:start position:0%
really does because it's hard to find
 

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:12.420 align:start position:0%
really does because it's hard to find
good<00:28:11.140><c> information</c><00:28:11.440><c> on</c><00:28:11.860><c> it</c><00:28:11.980><c> there's</c><00:28:12.130><c> a</c><00:28:12.190><c> little</c>

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:12.430 align:start position:0%
good information on it there's a little
 

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:14.670 align:start position:0%
good information on it there's a little
bit<00:28:12.580><c> of</c><00:28:12.610><c> information</c><00:28:12.940><c> but</c><00:28:13.330><c> so</c><00:28:13.870><c> basically</c><00:28:14.470><c> this</c>

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:14.680 align:start position:0%
bit of information but so basically this
 

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:20.010 align:start position:0%
bit of information but so basically this
is<00:28:14.740><c> a</c><00:28:15.600><c> 5</c><00:28:16.600><c> mobiles</c><00:28:17.140><c> three</c><00:28:17.950><c> of</c><00:28:18.730><c> them</c><00:28:18.970><c> are</c><00:28:19.270><c> female</c>

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:20.020 align:start position:0%
is a 5 mobiles three of them are female
 

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.930 align:start position:0%
is a 5 mobiles three of them are female
two<00:28:20.350><c> of</c><00:28:20.500><c> them</c><00:28:20.650><c> are</c><00:28:20.830><c> male</c><00:28:21.130><c> and</c><00:28:21.370><c> they</c>

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:21.940 align:start position:0%
two of them are male and they
 

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.970 align:start position:0%
two of them are male and they
communicate<00:28:22.210><c> through</c><00:28:22.990><c> shooting</c><00:28:23.230><c> lights</c><00:28:23.650><c> at</c>

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:23.980 align:start position:0%
communicate through shooting lights at
 

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:26.190 align:start position:0%
communicate through shooting lights at
each<00:28:24.130><c> other</c><00:28:24.400><c> and</c><00:28:24.750><c> reflecting</c><00:28:25.750><c> them</c><00:28:25.960><c> with</c>

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:26.200 align:start position:0%
each other and reflecting them with
 

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
each other and reflecting them with
mirrors<00:28:26.590><c> so</c><00:28:26.800><c> again</c><00:28:27.040><c> there's</c><00:28:27.250><c> lights</c><00:28:27.520><c> and</c>

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:27.730 align:start position:0%
mirrors so again there's lights and
 

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
mirrors so again there's lights and
mirrors<00:28:28.140><c> but</c><00:28:29.140><c> this</c><00:28:29.740><c> also</c><00:28:29.980><c> includes</c><00:28:30.450><c> to</c><00:28:31.450><c> Gordon</c>

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:32.170 align:start position:0%

Pask<00:28:32.380><c> was</c><00:28:34.500><c> cyber</c><00:28:35.500><c> notation</c><00:28:35.950><c> and</c><00:28:36.190><c> so</c><00:28:36.700><c> he</c><00:28:37.090><c> was</c><00:28:37.330><c> an</c>

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:37.900 align:start position:0%
Pask was cyber notation and so he was an
 

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
Pask was cyber notation and so he was an
artist<00:28:38.350><c> and</c><00:28:38.770><c> a</c><00:28:39.010><c> scientist</c><00:28:39.430><c> at</c><00:28:39.730><c> the</c><00:28:39.970><c> same</c><00:28:40.240><c> time</c>

artist and a scientist at the same time
 

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
artist and a scientist at the same time
he<00:28:40.600><c> was</c><00:28:40.660><c> interested</c><00:28:40.990><c> in</c><00:28:41.260><c> psychology</c><00:28:41.850><c> and</c><00:28:42.850><c> so</c>

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:43.570 align:start position:0%
he was interested in psychology and so
 

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:46.050 align:start position:0%
he was interested in psychology and so
this<00:28:43.810><c> work</c><00:28:44.050><c> is</c><00:28:44.290><c> is</c><00:28:44.560><c> a</c><00:28:44.980><c> kinetic</c><00:28:45.490><c> sculpture</c><00:28:45.880><c> but</c>

00:28:46.050 --> 00:28:46.060 align:start position:0%
this work is is a kinetic sculpture but
 

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:49.110 align:start position:0%
this work is is a kinetic sculpture but
the<00:28:47.020><c> females</c><00:28:47.260><c> and</c><00:28:47.680><c> males</c><00:28:47.740><c> try</c><00:28:48.340><c> to</c><00:28:48.400><c> learn</c><00:28:49.060><c> from</c>

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
the females and males try to learn from
 

00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.030 align:start position:0%
the females and males try to learn from
each<00:28:49.420><c> other</c><00:28:49.690><c> and</c><00:28:50.050><c> try</c><00:28:50.350><c> to</c><00:28:50.410><c> develop</c><00:28:50.650><c> a</c><00:28:50.860><c> language</c>

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
each other and try to develop a language
 

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:56.250 align:start position:0%
each other and try to develop a language
and<00:28:51.610><c> so</c><00:28:53.430><c> there's</c><00:28:54.430><c> some</c><00:28:55.300><c> computer</c><00:28:55.750><c> far</c><00:28:56.080><c> off</c>

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:56.260 align:start position:0%
and so there's some computer far off
 

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:58.710 align:start position:0%
and so there's some computer far off
because<00:28:56.590><c> at</c><00:28:56.710><c> that</c><00:28:56.830><c> time</c><00:28:57.360><c> there</c><00:28:58.360><c> weren't</c><00:28:58.510><c> any</c>

00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
because at that time there weren't any

00:29:00.330 --> 00:29:00.340 align:start position:0%
little Arduino is a raspberry PI's to
 

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:03.930 align:start position:0%
little Arduino is a raspberry PI's to

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:03.940 align:start position:0%
stick in there and they start off not
 

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.430 align:start position:0%
stick in there and they start off not
knowing<00:29:04.000><c> about</c><00:29:04.390><c> each</c><00:29:04.630><c> other</c><00:29:04.840><c> but</c><00:29:05.080><c> through</c>

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
knowing about each other but through
 

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:09.660 align:start position:0%
knowing about each other but through

00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:09.670 align:start position:0%
feedback mechanisms they learn to
 

00:29:09.670 --> 00:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
feedback mechanisms they learn to

00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:11.170 align:start position:0%
communicate with each other and so
 

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:13.230 align:start position:0%
communicate with each other and so
certain<00:29:11.560><c> movements</c><00:29:12.160><c> start</c><00:29:12.850><c> to</c><00:29:12.940><c> happen</c><00:29:13.090><c> more</c>

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
certain movements start to happen more
 

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.570 align:start position:0%
certain movements start to happen more
often<00:29:13.510><c> because</c><00:29:13.720><c> they</c><00:29:13.960><c> know</c><00:29:14.140><c> that</c><00:29:14.170><c> oh</c><00:29:14.650><c> this</c><00:29:15.370><c> way</c>

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:15.580 align:start position:0%
often because they know that oh this way
 

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:17.070 align:start position:0%
often because they know that oh this way
I<00:29:15.610><c> will</c><00:29:15.790><c> be</c><00:29:15.940><c> in</c><00:29:16.060><c> touch</c><00:29:16.210><c> with</c><00:29:16.450><c> that</c><00:29:16.480><c> guy</c><00:29:16.630><c> in</c><00:29:16.960><c> this</c>

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
I will be in touch with that guy in this
 

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.710 align:start position:0%
I will be in touch with that guy in this
way<00:29:17.260><c> I'll</c><00:29:17.350><c> be</c><00:29:17.380><c> in</c><00:29:17.620><c> touch</c><00:29:17.740><c> with</c><00:29:17.980><c> with</c><00:29:18.310><c> this</c><00:29:18.460><c> guy</c>

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
way I'll be in touch with with this guy
 

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:22.290 align:start position:0%
way I'll be in touch with with this guy
and<00:29:19.720><c> so</c><00:29:20.050><c> this</c><00:29:20.170><c> again</c><00:29:20.470><c> goes</c><00:29:20.500><c> back</c><00:29:20.680><c> to</c><00:29:20.980><c> like</c><00:29:21.300><c> this</c>

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:22.300 align:start position:0%
and so this again goes back to like this
 

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.390 align:start position:0%
and so this again goes back to like this
is<00:29:22.480><c> like</c><00:29:22.720><c> a</c><00:29:22.960><c> very</c><00:29:23.350><c> interesting</c><00:29:23.950><c> sort</c><00:29:24.160><c> of</c><00:29:24.250><c> way</c>

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:24.400 align:start position:0%
is like a very interesting sort of way
 

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
is like a very interesting sort of way
of<00:29:25.980><c> networking</c><00:29:26.980><c> I</c><00:29:27.370><c> guess</c><00:29:27.660><c> and</c><00:29:28.770><c> creating</c><00:29:29.770><c> an</c>

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:29.890 align:start position:0%
of networking I guess and creating an
 

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
of networking I guess and creating an

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:31.690 align:start position:0%
artificial language it's sort of a I
 

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:37.290 align:start position:0%
artificial language it's sort of a I
stuff<00:29:32.280><c> but</c><00:29:33.280><c> it's</c><00:29:33.430><c> you</c><00:29:33.670><c> know</c><00:29:33.730><c> 1968</c><00:29:34.630><c> a</c><00:29:35.350><c> piece</c><00:29:36.340><c> but</c>

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:37.300 align:start position:0%
stuff but it's you know 1968 a piece but
 

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
stuff but it's you know 1968 a piece but

what I really like about this way of
 

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:41.220 align:start position:0%
what I really like about this way of
working<00:29:39.880><c> is</c><00:29:40.180><c> that</c><00:29:40.420><c> you</c><00:29:40.600><c> create</c><00:29:41.020><c> this</c>

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:41.230 align:start position:0%
working is that you create this
 

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:44.190 align:start position:0%
working is that you create this
generative<00:29:41.920><c> system</c><00:29:42.550><c> which</c><00:29:43.360><c> at</c><00:29:43.660><c> some</c><00:29:43.720><c> point</c>

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:46.630 align:start position:0%
will will run by itself by interaction
 

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:48.600 align:start position:0%

with all these things really hard to
 

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:42.780 align:start position:0%
with all these things really hard to
it's<00:32:40.670><c> actually</c><00:32:41.150><c> like</c><00:32:41.300><c> erasing</c><00:32:41.840><c> the</c><00:32:42.170><c> space</c>

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:42.790 align:start position:0%
it's actually like erasing the space
 

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.730 align:start position:0%
it's actually like erasing the space
just<00:32:43.790><c> taking</c><00:32:44.150><c> the</c><00:32:44.240><c> space</c><00:32:44.480><c> away</c><00:32:44.690><c> by</c><00:32:45.440><c> blurring</c>

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:45.740 align:start position:0%
just taking the space away by blurring
 

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:48.730 align:start position:0%
just taking the space away by blurring
here<00:32:46.040><c> it's</c><00:32:46.640><c> really</c><00:32:46.820><c> hard</c><00:32:46.940><c> to</c><00:32:47.390><c> two</c><00:32:47.630><c> films</c><00:32:48.020><c> such</c>

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:48.740 align:start position:0%
here it's really hard to two films such
 

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:52.780 align:start position:0%
here it's really hard to two films such

00:35:58.730 --> 00:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
generate energy and they will use this
 

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
generate energy and they will use this

inside<00:36:04.530><c> the</c><00:36:04.740><c> units</c><00:36:05.069><c> there's</c><00:36:05.250><c> also</c><00:36:05.460><c> a</c><00:36:06.049><c> light</c>

00:36:07.039 --> 00:36:07.049 align:start position:0%
inside the units there's also a light
 

00:36:07.049 --> 00:36:09.700 align:start position:0%
inside the units there's also a light
sensor<00:36:07.380><c> so</c><00:36:08.220><c> they</c><00:36:08.339><c> will</c><00:36:08.460><c> influence</c><00:36:08.910><c> each</c><00:36:09.359><c> other</c>

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:09.710 align:start position:0%
sensor so they will influence each other
 

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:13.930 align:start position:0%
sensor so they will influence each other
in<00:36:10.789><c> the</c><00:36:11.789><c> way</c><00:36:12.000><c> they</c><00:36:12.180><c> produce</c><00:36:12.390><c> their</c><00:36:12.780><c> sound</c><00:36:13.079><c> and</c>

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:13.940 align:start position:0%
in the way they produce their sound and
 

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:19.190 align:start position:0%
in the way they produce their sound and
so<00:36:15.650><c> this</c><00:36:16.650><c> actually</c><00:36:16.920><c> heart</c><00:36:17.670><c> like</c><00:36:18.299><c> goes</c><00:36:18.780><c> back</c><00:36:19.020><c> to</c>

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
so this actually heart like goes back to
 

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.260 align:start position:0%
so this actually heart like goes back to

00:36:28.849 --> 00:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
of these elements in it I can I can play
 

00:36:28.859 --> 00:36:51.030 align:start position:0%
of these elements in it I can I can play
a<00:36:29.010><c> bit</c><00:36:29.880><c> so</c><00:36:30.089><c> you</c><00:36:30.180><c> can</c><00:36:30.240><c> see</c><00:36:30.359><c> it</c><00:36:31.130><c> functioning</c>

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:55.690 align:start position:0%

00:36:55.690 --> 00:36:55.700 align:start position:0%
so this was in the in November and in
 

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.490 align:start position:0%
so this was in the in November and in

00:36:57.490 --> 00:36:57.500 align:start position:0%
November in the Arctic region the Sun
 

00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:01.210 align:start position:0%

doesn't<00:36:58.280><c> rise</c><00:36:58.609><c> anymore</c><00:36:59.510><c> so</c><00:37:00.260><c> you</c><00:37:00.320><c> have</c><00:37:00.800><c> a</c><00:37:00.830><c> polar</c>

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:01.220 align:start position:0%
doesn't rise anymore so you have a polar
 

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.900 align:start position:0%
doesn't rise anymore so you have a polar
night<00:37:01.550><c> and</c><00:37:02.890><c> which</c><00:37:03.890><c> means</c><00:37:04.190><c> that</c><00:37:04.460><c> there's</c><00:37:04.700><c> a</c>

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:04.910 align:start position:0%

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:06.820 align:start position:0%

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:06.830 align:start position:0%

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:09.770 align:start position:0%
the day it's it's dark and so it really

the day it's it's dark and so it really

would<00:37:39.470><c> be</c><00:37:39.530><c> some</c><00:37:39.859><c> kind</c><00:37:40.099><c> of</c><00:37:40.190><c> manmade</c><00:37:40.520><c> phenomena</c>

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:41.390 align:start position:0%
would be some kind of manmade phenomena
 

00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:44.290 align:start position:0%
would be some kind of manmade phenomena

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
functioning there under circum shirt
circumstances<00:37:53.500><c> like</c><00:37:54.500><c> so</c><00:37:54.710><c> it's</c><00:37:54.859><c> wind</c><00:37:55.070><c> driven</c>

00:37:55.359 --> 00:37:55.369 align:start position:0%
circumstances like so it's wind driven
 

00:37:55.369 --> 00:37:57.310 align:start position:0%
circumstances like so it's wind driven
but<00:37:55.670><c> also</c><00:37:55.730><c> it</c><00:37:56.089><c> wouldn't</c><00:37:56.599><c> work</c><00:37:56.720><c> if</c><00:37:56.930><c> it</c><00:37:57.050><c> would</c><00:37:57.200><c> be</c>

00:37:57.310 --> 00:37:57.320 align:start position:0%
but also it wouldn't work if it would be
 

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.380 align:start position:0%
but also it wouldn't work if it would be
light<00:37:57.560><c> or</c><00:37:57.920><c> if</c><00:37:58.130><c> there</c><00:37:58.339><c> was</c><00:37:58.460><c> no</c><00:37:58.670><c> wind</c><00:37:58.910><c> so</c><00:37:59.210><c> it's</c>

00:37:59.380 --> 00:37:59.390 align:start position:0%
light or if there was no wind so it's
 

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:00.820 align:start position:0%
light or if there was no wind so it's
like<00:37:59.480><c> this</c><00:37:59.780><c> this</c><00:38:00.020><c> phenomena</c><00:38:00.500><c> that</c><00:38:00.589><c> you</c><00:38:00.710><c> can</c>

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:00.830 align:start position:0%
like this this phenomena that you can
 

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:02.589 align:start position:0%
like this this phenomena that you can
experience<00:38:01.190><c> only</c><00:38:01.700><c> when</c><00:38:02.119><c> it's</c><00:38:02.300><c> when</c>

00:38:02.589 --> 00:38:02.599 align:start position:0%
experience only when it's when
 

00:38:02.599 --> 00:38:04.390 align:start position:0%
experience only when it's when
everything<00:38:03.230><c> is</c><00:38:03.380><c> in</c><00:38:03.560><c> the</c><00:38:03.680><c> in</c><00:38:03.859><c> the</c><00:38:03.890><c> right</c><00:38:04.130><c> order</c>

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
everything is in the in the right order
 

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.490 align:start position:0%
everything is in the in the right order
so<00:38:04.970><c> you</c><00:38:05.030><c> need</c><00:38:05.359><c> a</c><00:38:05.390><c> natural</c><00:38:05.900><c> phenomena</c>

00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:06.500 align:start position:0%
so you need a natural phenomena
 

00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:08.890 align:start position:0%
so you need a natural phenomena
amplified<00:38:07.310><c> by</c><00:38:07.730><c> human</c><00:38:08.150><c> creation</c><00:38:08.660><c> and</c><00:38:08.839><c> the</c>

00:38:08.890 --> 00:38:08.900 align:start position:0%
amplified by human creation and the
 

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:11.859 align:start position:0%
amplified by human creation and the
Machine<00:38:09.200><c> yeah</c><00:38:10.160><c> beautiful</c><00:38:10.910><c> I</c><00:38:11.270><c> think</c><00:38:11.570><c> is</c><00:38:11.660><c> really</c>

00:38:11.859 --> 00:38:11.869 align:start position:0%
Machine yeah beautiful I think is really
 

00:38:11.869 --> 00:38:13.390 align:start position:0%

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
beautiful about it also like you can
 

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
beautiful about it also like you can
just<00:38:13.430><c> leave</c><00:38:13.700><c> that</c><00:38:13.849><c> there</c><00:38:14.030><c> and</c><00:38:14.089><c> nobody</c><00:38:14.570><c> has</c><00:38:14.690><c> to</c>

00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:14.810 align:start position:0%
just leave that there and nobody has to
 

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:16.750 align:start position:0%
just leave that there and nobody has to
watch<00:38:14.990><c> it</c><00:38:15.260><c> and</c><00:38:15.470><c> it</c><00:38:15.710><c> can</c><00:38:15.830><c> take</c><00:38:16.010><c> it</c><00:38:16.339><c> can</c><00:38:16.490><c> just</c><00:38:16.609><c> be</c>

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
watch it and it can take it can just be
 

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:18.550 align:start position:0%
watch it and it can take it can just be
there<00:38:17.210><c> and</c><00:38:17.420><c> live</c><00:38:17.869><c> and</c><00:38:18.080><c> I</c><00:38:18.109><c> really</c><00:38:18.349><c> I</c><00:38:18.470><c> really</c>

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:22.940 align:start position:0%
create this land art piece that can just
 

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:26.290 align:start position:0%
create this land art piece that can just
go<00:38:23.240><c> and</c><00:38:23.540><c> it</c><00:38:24.170><c> self</c><00:38:24.410><c> sustainable</c><00:38:24.859><c> one</c><00:38:25.130><c> yeah</c><00:38:26.060><c> so</c>
