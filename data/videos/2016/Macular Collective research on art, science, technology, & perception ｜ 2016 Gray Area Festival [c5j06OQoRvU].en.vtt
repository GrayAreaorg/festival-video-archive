00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
can do the same with the soap film but
 

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.330 align:start position:0%
can do the same with the soap film but
you<00:08:59.270><c> need</c><00:08:59.420><c> minus</c><00:08:59.870><c> 30</c><00:09:00.170><c> degrees</c><00:09:00.290><c> Celsius</c><00:09:01.190><c> I</c>

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:13.790 align:start position:0%
minute this lasted like 30 minutes so we
 

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.450 align:start position:0%
minute this lasted like 30 minutes so we

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:16.460 align:start position:0%
took like a short example or 15-minute
 

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.910 align:start position:0%
took like a short example or 15-minute

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.890 align:start position:0%

like we don't explain what the process
 

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.020 align:start position:0%
like we don't explain what the process
is<00:10:50.630><c> we</c><00:10:51.200><c> just</c><00:10:51.470><c> should</c><00:10:51.830><c> we</c><00:10:52.070><c> make</c><00:10:52.250><c> a</c><00:10:52.280><c> composition</c>

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:53.030 align:start position:0%
is we just should we make a composition
 

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.110 align:start position:0%
is we just should we make a composition

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
with the images and make our own
 

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.140 align:start position:0%
with the images and make our own
soundtrack<00:10:56.630><c> so</c><00:10:57.050><c> the</c><00:10:57.740><c> end</c><00:10:57.860><c> result</c><00:10:58.040><c> is</c><00:10:58.430><c> not</c><00:10:58.640><c> to</c>

let<00:11:18.560><c> me</c><00:11:18.650><c> just</c><00:11:19.270><c> see</c><00:11:20.270><c> where</c><00:11:20.450><c> it</c><00:11:20.480><c> is</c><00:11:20.690><c> or</c><00:11:20.930><c> not</c><00:11:20.990><c> maybe</c>

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:21.350 align:start position:0%
let me just see where it is or not maybe
 

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
let me just see where it is or not maybe

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:32.970 align:start position:0%

and so part of it is about perception
also

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:42.990 align:start position:0%
also

also

I think can revolve the flickering of

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
the image you get these after images and
 

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.260 align:start position:0%
the image you get these after images and
in<00:14:49.800><c> my</c><00:14:50.220><c> piece</c><00:14:50.459><c> there's</c><00:14:50.670><c> also</c><00:14:50.850><c> a</c><00:14:51.000><c> lot</c><00:14:51.240><c> of</c>

in my piece there's also a lot of
 

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
in my piece there's also a lot of

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:36.530 align:start position:0%
use his microscope and and i ended up
 

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.710 align:start position:0%
use his microscope and and i ended up

that's<00:23:37.890><c> interesting</c><00:23:38.430><c> for</c><00:23:38.640><c> them</c><00:23:38.760><c> and</c><00:23:39.000><c> I</c>

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%

that's interesting for them and I

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:56.250 align:start position:0%
manner mm yeah I think CERN is it may be
 

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
manner mm yeah I think CERN is it may be
a<00:23:56.340><c> good</c><00:23:56.460><c> example</c><00:23:56.640><c> you</c><00:23:57.120><c> need</c><00:23:57.270><c> time</c><00:23:57.480><c> and</c><00:23:57.750><c> money</c>

00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:57.930 align:start position:0%
a good example you need time and money
 

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:00.290 align:start position:0%
a good example you need time and money
that<00:23:58.350><c> both</c><00:23:58.650><c> parties</c><00:23:58.920><c> can</c><00:23:59.280><c> really</c><00:23:59.550><c> work</c><00:23:59.970><c> when</c>

materials to build that kind of self I
 

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
materials to build that kind of self I

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:54.330 align:start position:0%
think this this these accidents and

00:25:59.330 --> 00:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
a big part of our work just playing with
 

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.310 align:start position:0%
a big part of our work just playing with
materials<00:25:59.970><c> with</c><00:26:00.180><c> certain</c><00:26:00.510><c> ideas</c><00:26:00.780><c> concepts</c>

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
materials with certain ideas concepts
 

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:05.630 align:start position:0%
materials with certain ideas concepts
and<00:26:01.500><c> uh</c><00:26:02.120><c> by</c><00:26:03.120><c> playing</c><00:26:03.450><c> finding</c><00:26:04.200><c> out</c><00:26:04.640><c> their</c>

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
and uh by playing finding out their
 

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.490 align:start position:0%
and uh by playing finding out their
qualities<00:26:06.150><c> and</c><00:26:06.330><c> characteristics</c><00:26:07.050><c> and</c>

00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:07.500 align:start position:0%

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
qualities and characteristics and
aspects<00:26:07.920><c> so</c><00:26:08.670><c> was</c><00:26:08.880><c> it</c><00:26:08.910><c> more</c><00:26:09.270><c> like</c><00:26:09.300><c> stumble</c><00:26:09.930><c> over</c>

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:10.050 align:start position:0%
aspects so was it more like stumble over
 

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:11.870 align:start position:0%
aspects so was it more like stumble over
in<00:26:10.350><c> it</c><00:26:10.470><c> and</c><00:26:10.650><c> rather</c><00:26:10.830><c> looking</c><00:26:11.310><c> for</c><00:26:11.520><c> something</c>

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
in it and rather looking for something
 

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.660 align:start position:0%
in it and rather looking for something
that<00:26:11.910><c> you</c><00:26:12.330><c> already</c><00:26:12.480><c> have</c><00:26:12.870><c> in</c><00:26:12.900><c> mind</c><00:26:13.290><c> yeah</c><00:26:13.980><c> and</c>

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:14.670 align:start position:0%
that you already have in mind yeah and
 

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:18.680 align:start position:0%
that you already have in mind yeah and
again<00:26:14.760><c> this</c><00:26:15.030><c> is</c><00:26:15.240><c> like</c><00:26:15.450><c> this</c><00:26:16.170><c> is</c><00:26:16.310><c> cinema</c><00:26:17.690><c> but</c>

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:18.690 align:start position:0%
again this is like this is cinema but
 

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:20.780 align:start position:0%
again this is like this is cinema but
it's<00:26:18.960><c> an</c><00:26:19.170><c> extremely</c><00:26:19.680><c> physical</c><00:26:20.310><c> type</c><00:26:20.580><c> of</c>

00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:20.790 align:start position:0%
it's an extremely physical type of
 

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:22.700 align:start position:0%
it's an extremely physical type of
cinema<00:26:21.210><c> you</c><00:26:21.390><c> know</c><00:26:21.450><c> built</c><00:26:21.870><c> out</c><00:26:22.050><c> of</c><00:26:22.080><c> lights</c><00:26:22.410><c> and</c>

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:22.710 align:start position:0%
cinema you know built out of lights and
 

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
cinema you know built out of lights and
and<00:26:22.980><c> and</c>

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:24.410 align:start position:0%
and and
 

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:27.370 align:start position:0%
and and
objects<00:26:25.410><c> moving</c><00:26:25.680><c> moving</c><00:26:26.340><c> objects</c><00:26:26.850><c> so</c><00:26:27.000><c> that</c>

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:27.380 align:start position:0%
objects moving moving objects so that
 

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:31.220 align:start position:0%
objects moving moving objects so that
went<00:26:28.380><c> from</c><00:26:28.530><c> one</c><00:26:28.680><c> is</c><00:26:28.800><c> this</c><00:26:28.950><c> this</c><00:26:29.130><c> is</c><00:26:29.190><c> like</c><00:26:29.780><c> 36</c><00:26:30.780><c> 40</c>

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:31.230 align:start position:0%
went from one is this this is like 36 40
 

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
went from one is this this is like 36 40
something<00:26:31.500><c> like</c><00:26:31.620><c> that</c><00:26:31.800><c> maybe</c><00:26:32.400><c> the</c><00:26:32.670><c> video</c><00:26:33.270><c> says</c>

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:33.570 align:start position:0%
something like that maybe the video says
 

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:34.300 align:start position:0%
something like that maybe the video says
it

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:34.310 align:start position:0%
it
 

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:36.620 align:start position:0%
it
yeah<00:26:35.310><c> i</c><00:26:35.340><c> think</c><00:26:35.490><c> this</c><00:26:35.730><c> this</c><00:26:36.090><c> is</c><00:26:36.240><c> one</c><00:26:36.390><c> of</c><00:26:36.420><c> his</c>

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:36.630 align:start position:0%
yeah i think this this is one of his
 

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i think this this is one of his
latest<00:26:36.900><c> yeah</c><00:26:37.860><c> so</c><00:26:38.160><c> 48</c><00:26:38.520><c> yeah</c><00:26:39.080><c> so</c><00:26:40.080><c> for</c><00:26:40.320><c> me</c><00:26:40.410><c> that's</c>

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:40.530 align:start position:0%
latest yeah so 48 yeah so for me that's
 

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:41.570 align:start position:0%
latest yeah so 48 yeah so for me that's
also<00:26:40.860><c> one</c><00:26:40.980><c> of</c><00:26:41.010><c> the</c><00:26:41.130><c> things</c><00:26:41.340><c> that</c><00:26:41.400><c> I'm</c><00:26:41.550><c> really</c>

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
also one of the things that I'm really
 

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
also one of the things that I'm really
interested<00:26:41.790><c> in</c><00:26:42.150><c> is</c><00:26:42.330><c> like</c><00:26:42.450><c> we</c><00:26:42.990><c> work</c><00:26:43.530><c> in</c><00:26:43.710><c> art</c><00:26:43.890><c> and</c>

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:44.010 align:start position:0%
interested in is like we work in art and
 

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:47.060 align:start position:0%
interested in is like we work in art and
technology<00:26:44.610><c> um</c><00:26:44.880><c> and</c><00:26:45.600><c> there's</c><00:26:46.380><c> his</c><00:26:46.560><c> idea</c><00:26:46.920><c> like</c>

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:47.070 align:start position:0%
technology um and there's his idea like
 

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:49.130 align:start position:0%
technology um and there's his idea like
oh<00:26:47.190><c> we're</c><00:26:47.370><c> doing</c><00:26:47.520><c> the</c><00:26:47.790><c> newest</c><00:26:48.390><c> latest</c><00:26:48.660><c> thing</c>

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:49.140 align:start position:0%
oh we're doing the newest latest thing
 

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.020 align:start position:0%
oh we're doing the newest latest thing
but<00:26:49.470><c> actually</c><00:26:49.740><c> there's</c><00:26:50.490><c> a</c><00:26:50.580><c> really</c><00:26:50.880><c> big</c>

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:51.030 align:start position:0%
but actually there's a really big
 

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:52.940 align:start position:0%
but actually there's a really big
history<00:26:51.450><c> to</c><00:26:51.570><c> all</c><00:26:51.690><c> of</c><00:26:51.840><c> this</c><00:26:51.960><c> and</c><00:26:52.500><c> I</c><00:26:52.620><c> think</c><00:26:52.830><c> it's</c>

00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:52.950 align:start position:0%
history to all of this and I think it's
 

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:55.160 align:start position:0%
history to all of this and I think it's
really<00:26:53.010><c> important</c><00:26:53.580><c> to</c><00:26:53.640><c> be</c><00:26:53.940><c> aware</c><00:26:54.180><c> of</c><00:26:54.480><c> that</c><00:26:54.630><c> and</c>

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:55.170 align:start position:0%
really important to be aware of that and
 

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:58.460 align:start position:0%
really important to be aware of that and
and<00:26:55.620><c> and</c><00:26:56.310><c> it's</c><00:26:57.030><c> also</c><00:26:57.120><c> a</c><00:26:57.240><c> lot</c><00:26:57.870><c> of</c><00:26:57.960><c> Forgotten</c>

00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:58.470 align:start position:0%
and and it's also a lot of Forgotten
 

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:00.170 align:start position:0%
and and it's also a lot of Forgotten
technology<00:26:59.130><c> yeah</c><00:26:59.340><c> that's</c><00:26:59.670><c> very</c><00:26:59.970><c> interesting</c>

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:00.180 align:start position:0%
technology yeah that's very interesting
 

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:03.740 align:start position:0%
technology yeah that's very interesting
and<00:27:00.690><c> to</c><00:27:00.900><c> work</c><00:27:01.050><c> with</c><00:27:01.320><c> I</c><00:27:01.820><c> think</c><00:27:02.820><c> also</c><00:27:03.090><c> going</c><00:27:03.390><c> back</c>

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:03.750 align:start position:0%
and to work with I think also going back
 

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:05.870 align:start position:0%
and to work with I think also going back
to<00:27:03.960><c> to</c><00:27:04.260><c> these</c><00:27:04.440><c> pure</c><00:27:04.830><c> things</c><00:27:05.130><c> like</c><00:27:05.310><c> huh</c><00:27:05.550><c> what</c>

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
to to these pure things like huh what
 

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
to to these pure things like huh what
slide<00:27:06.150><c> how</c><00:27:06.510><c> is</c><00:27:06.570><c> it</c><00:27:06.660><c> working</c><00:27:07.190><c> all</c><00:27:08.190><c> these</c>

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:08.370 align:start position:0%
slide how is it working all these
 

00:27:08.370 --> 00:27:11.780 align:start position:0%
slide how is it working all these
aspects<00:27:08.880><c> yeah</c><00:27:09.570><c> I</c><00:27:09.630><c> think</c><00:27:09.750><c> because</c><00:27:10.200><c> I</c><00:27:10.650><c> like</c><00:27:11.640><c> it</c>

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:11.790 align:start position:0%
aspects yeah I think because I like it
 

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:13.640 align:start position:0%
aspects yeah I think because I like it
that<00:27:11.820><c> is</c><00:27:12.060><c> that</c><00:27:12.690><c> you</c><00:27:12.810><c> can</c><00:27:12.990><c> work</c><00:27:13.200><c> with</c><00:27:13.230><c> very</c>

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:13.650 align:start position:0%
that is that you can work with very
 

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:15.740 align:start position:0%
that is that you can work with very
simple<00:27:13.980><c> elements</c><00:27:14.730><c> like</c><00:27:15.000><c> I</c><00:27:15.210><c> think</c><00:27:15.450><c> most</c><00:27:15.630><c> of</c>

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:15.750 align:start position:0%
simple elements like I think most of
 

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.270 align:start position:0%
simple elements like I think most of
these<00:27:15.930><c> work</c><00:27:16.170><c> could</c><00:27:16.410><c> it</c><00:27:16.530><c> could</c><00:27:16.680><c> have</c><00:27:16.800><c> also</c><00:27:16.950><c> been</c>

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
these work could it could have also been
 

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.290 align:start position:0%
these work could it could have also been
done<00:27:17.520><c> like</c><00:27:18.110><c> decades</c><00:27:19.110><c> ago</c>

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:20.300 align:start position:0%
done like decades ago
 

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.820 align:start position:0%
done like decades ago
although<00:27:21.300><c> the</c><00:27:21.600><c> Arduino</c><00:27:22.140><c> ever</c><00:27:22.440><c> ask</c><00:27:22.560><c> me</c><00:27:22.620><c> goodbye</c>

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:22.830 align:start position:0%
although the Arduino ever ask me goodbye

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:29.140 align:start position:0%
again there's lights and mirrors but
 

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:34.490 align:start position:0%
again there's lights and mirrors but

so<00:29:11.170><c> certain</c><00:29:11.560><c> movements</c><00:29:12.160><c> start</c><00:29:12.850><c> to</c><00:29:12.940><c> happen</c>

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:13.090 align:start position:0%
so certain movements start to happen
 

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
so certain movements start to happen
more<00:29:13.240><c> often</c><00:29:13.510><c> because</c><00:29:13.720><c> they</c><00:29:13.960><c> know</c><00:29:14.140><c> that</c><00:29:14.170><c> oh</c>

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:14.650 align:start position:0%

this<00:29:15.370><c> way</c><00:29:15.580><c> I</c><00:29:15.610><c> will</c><00:29:15.790><c> be</c><00:29:15.940><c> in</c><00:29:16.060><c> touch</c><00:29:16.210><c> with</c><00:29:16.450><c> that</c>

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
this way I will be in touch with that
 

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.970 align:start position:0%
this way I will be in touch with that
guy<00:29:16.630><c> in</c><00:29:16.960><c> this</c><00:29:17.080><c> way</c><00:29:17.260><c> I'll</c><00:29:17.350><c> be</c><00:29:17.380><c> in</c><00:29:17.620><c> touch</c><00:29:17.740><c> with</c>

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:17.980 align:start position:0%
guy in this way I'll be in touch with
 

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:20.490 align:start position:0%

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:20.500 align:start position:0%
with this guy and so this again goes
 

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
with this guy and so this again goes
back<00:29:20.680><c> to</c><00:29:20.980><c> like</c><00:29:21.300><c> this</c><00:29:22.300><c> is</c><00:29:22.480><c> like</c><00:29:22.720><c> a</c><00:29:22.960><c> very</c>

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:23.350 align:start position:0%

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
interesting sort of way of
 

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
interesting sort of way of
networking<00:29:26.980><c> I</c><00:29:27.370><c> guess</c><00:29:27.660><c> and</c><00:29:28.770><c> creating</c><00:29:29.770><c> an</c>

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:29.890 align:start position:0%
networking I guess and creating an
 

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
networking I guess and creating an

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:31.690 align:start position:0%
artificial language it's sort of a I
 

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:37.290 align:start position:0%
artificial language it's sort of a I
stuff<00:29:32.280><c> but</c><00:29:33.280><c> it's</c><00:29:33.430><c> you</c><00:29:33.670><c> know</c><00:29:33.730><c> 1968</c><00:29:34.630><c> a</c><00:29:35.350><c> piece</c><00:29:36.340><c> but</c>

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:37.300 align:start position:0%
stuff but it's you know 1968 a piece but
 

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
stuff but it's you know 1968 a piece but
what<00:29:38.020><c> I</c><00:29:38.050><c> really</c><00:29:38.350><c> like</c><00:29:38.530><c> about</c><00:29:38.560><c> this</c><00:29:39.040><c> way</c><00:29:39.400><c> of</c>

00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:39.610 align:start position:0%
what I really like about this way of
 

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:41.220 align:start position:0%
what I really like about this way of
working<00:29:39.880><c> is</c><00:29:40.180><c> that</c><00:29:40.420><c> you</c><00:29:40.600><c> create</c><00:29:41.020><c> this</c>

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:41.230 align:start position:0%
working is that you create this
 

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:44.190 align:start position:0%
working is that you create this
generative<00:29:41.920><c> system</c><00:29:42.550><c> which</c><00:29:43.360><c> at</c><00:29:43.660><c> some</c><00:29:43.720><c> point</c>

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:44.200 align:start position:0%
generative system which at some point
 

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
generative system which at some point
will<00:29:44.710><c> will</c><00:29:45.160><c> run</c><00:29:45.370><c> by</c><00:29:45.550><c> itself</c><00:29:45.820><c> by</c><00:29:46.030><c> interaction</c>

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:46.630 align:start position:0%
will will run by itself by interaction
 

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:49.230 align:start position:0%
will will run by itself by interaction
and<00:29:46.960><c> and</c><00:29:47.200><c> for</c><00:29:47.680><c> us</c><00:29:47.710><c> as</c><00:29:48.100><c> humans</c><00:29:48.610><c> basically</c><00:29:49.059><c> just</c>

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
and and for us as humans basically just
 

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
and and for us as humans basically just
like<00:29:49.330><c> this</c><00:29:49.660><c> generative</c><00:29:50.790><c> composition</c><00:29:51.790><c> for</c>

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:52.570 align:start position:0%
like this generative composition for
 

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:55.340 align:start position:0%
like this generative composition for
lights<00:29:53.020><c> and</c><00:29:53.320><c> movement</c><00:29:53.830><c> and</c>

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:55.350 align:start position:0%
lights and movement and
 

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:58.350 align:start position:0%
lights and movement and
and<00:29:56.350><c> it</c><00:29:56.770><c> becomes</c><00:29:57.010><c> a</c><00:29:57.160><c> thing</c><00:29:57.340><c> where</c><00:29:57.610><c> they</c><00:29:58.059><c> have</c>

00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:58.360 align:start position:0%

doesn't<00:36:58.280><c> rise</c><00:36:58.609><c> anymore</c><00:36:59.510><c> so</c><00:37:00.260><c> you</c><00:37:00.320><c> have</c><00:37:00.800><c> a</c><00:37:00.830><c> polar</c>

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:01.220 align:start position:0%
doesn't rise anymore so you have a polar
 

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't rise anymore so you have a polar
night<00:37:01.550><c> and</c>

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:02.890 align:start position:0%
night and
 

00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:05.410 align:start position:0%
night and
which<00:37:03.890><c> means</c><00:37:04.190><c> that</c><00:37:04.460><c> there's</c><00:37:04.700><c> a</c><00:37:04.910><c> little</c><00:37:05.180><c> bit</c><00:37:05.359><c> of</c>

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:00.020 align:start position:0%
there was no wind so it's like this this
 

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:01.690 align:start position:0%
there was no wind so it's like this this
