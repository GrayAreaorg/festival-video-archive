00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 align:start position:0%

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:52.350 align:start position:0%
what was going on in the game world so
 

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
what was going on in the game world so
we<00:08:52.800><c> felt</c><00:08:53.040><c> that</c><00:08:53.370><c> with</c><00:08:54.030><c> the</c><00:08:54.180><c> addition</c><00:08:54.570><c> of</c><00:08:54.690><c> this</c>

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:54.810 align:start position:0%
we felt that with the addition of this
 

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:56.570 align:start position:0%
we felt that with the addition of this
head<00:08:55.050><c> tracking</c><00:08:55.350><c> we</c><00:08:55.740><c> were</c><00:08:55.860><c> able</c><00:08:56.040><c> to</c><00:08:56.190><c> kind</c><00:08:56.460><c> of</c>

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
head tracking we were able to kind of
 

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
head tracking we were able to kind of

00:08:59.360 --> 00:08:59.370 align:start position:0%
solve that particular question so the
 

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:01.250 align:start position:0%
solve that particular question so the

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
real answer is the stereoscopic vision
 

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.890 align:start position:0%
real answer is the stereoscopic vision
doesn't<00:09:02.010><c> do</c><00:09:02.340><c> too</c><00:09:02.550><c> much</c><00:09:02.580><c> on</c><00:09:03.090><c> its</c><00:09:03.300><c> own</c><00:09:03.510><c> but</c><00:09:03.750><c> when</c>

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
doesn't do too much on its own but when
 

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't do too much on its own but when
you<00:09:03.990><c> add</c><00:09:04.200><c> that</c><00:09:04.500><c> element</c><00:09:04.650><c> of</c><00:09:05.070><c> where</c><00:09:05.310><c> is</c><00:09:05.490><c> your</c>

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:05.670 align:start position:0%
you add that element of where is your
 

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:07.970 align:start position:0%
you add that element of where is your
