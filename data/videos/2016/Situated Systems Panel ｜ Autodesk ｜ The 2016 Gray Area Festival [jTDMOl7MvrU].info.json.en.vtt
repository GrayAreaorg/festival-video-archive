00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:50.310 align:start position:0%
earlier in the week and she said
 

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:51.940 align:start position:0%
earlier in the week and she said
something<00:07:50.610><c> that</c><00:07:50.640><c> really</c><00:07:50.760><c> struck</c><00:07:51.450><c> me</c><00:07:51.480><c> about</c>

something that really struck me about

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.990 align:start position:0%

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:03.290 align:start position:0%
it goes and that's difficult right
 

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:04.510 align:start position:0%
