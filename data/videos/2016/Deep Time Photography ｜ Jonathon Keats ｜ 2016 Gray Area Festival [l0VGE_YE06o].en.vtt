00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
is happening is that you have a pinhole
 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.970 align:start position:0%
is happening is that you have a pinhole

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 align:start position:0%
me is that when you place one of these

me is that when you place one of these
