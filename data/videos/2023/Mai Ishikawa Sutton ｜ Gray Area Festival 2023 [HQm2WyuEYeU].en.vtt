into this idea of a camp um because uh
 

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.189 align:start position:0%
into this idea of a camp um because uh
we<00:14:07.519><c> didn't</c><00:14:07.759><c> really</c><00:14:08.079><c> have</c><00:14:08.360><c> a</c><00:14:08.560><c> hacker</c><00:14:08.959><c> Camp</c><00:14:09.720><c> um</c>

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
on in California um and so actually it
 

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.189 align:start position:0%
on in California um and so actually it
was<00:14:12.480><c> Brewster's</c><00:14:13.000><c> idea</c><00:14:13.360><c> Brewster</c><00:14:13.759><c> kale</c><00:14:14.120><c> the</c>

00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
like what if we just turned the dweb sum
 

00:14:18.199 --> 00:14:20.749 align:start position:0%
like what if we just turned the dweb sum
into<00:14:18.399><c> a</c><00:14:18.639><c> camp</c><00:14:19.519><c> and</c><00:14:19.639><c> so</c><00:14:19.920><c> that's</c><00:14:20.199><c> exactly</c><00:14:20.639><c> what</c>

00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
technology is um I guess like that

so<00:20:20.840><c> that's</c><00:20:21.039><c> why</c><00:20:21.200><c> we</c><00:20:21.400><c> kind</c><00:20:21.480><c> of</c><00:20:21.600><c> created</c><00:20:21.960><c> compos</c>

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
so that's why we kind of created compos
 

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.390 align:start position:0%
so that's why we kind of created compos
so<00:20:22.919><c> that</c><00:20:23.080><c> there's</c><00:20:23.400><c> actually</c><00:20:23.679><c> artists</c><00:20:24.200><c> and</c>

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
so that there's actually artists and
 

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:25.750 align:start position:0%
so that there's actually artists and
people<00:20:24.640><c> who</c><00:20:24.760><c> are</c><00:20:24.960><c> thinking</c><00:20:25.280><c> about</c><00:20:25.559><c> this</c>
