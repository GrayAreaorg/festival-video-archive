but what do we do with it like how do we
 

00:22:57.419 --> 00:22:59.029 align:start position:0%
but what do we do with it like how do we

00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
talk to the plan how do we communicate
 

00:22:59.039 --> 00:23:00.350 align:start position:0%
talk to the plan how do we communicate
with<00:22:59.220><c> those</c><00:22:59.400><c> things</c><00:22:59.520><c> and</c><00:22:59.760><c> I</c><00:22:59.820><c> think</c><00:22:59.940><c> that</c><00:23:00.179><c> that</c>

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
with those things and I think that that
 

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:02.750 align:start position:0%
with those things and I think that that
that<00:23:00.480><c> was</c><00:23:01.320><c> probably</c><00:23:01.740><c> the</c><00:23:02.100><c> the</c><00:23:02.280><c> biggest</c><00:23:02.460><c> Step</c>

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
that was probably the the biggest Step
 

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.430 align:start position:0%
that was probably the the biggest Step
at<00:23:02.940><c> least</c><00:23:03.059><c> for</c><00:23:03.240><c> me</c>

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
at least for me
 

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.950 align:start position:0%
at least for me
yeah<00:23:05.039><c> just</c><00:23:05.580><c> to</c><00:23:06.059><c> add</c><00:23:06.240><c> to</c><00:23:06.419><c> that</c><00:23:06.539><c> I</c><00:23:06.840><c> think</c>

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
yeah just to add to that I think

weighs heavy on and so of course it was

never saw that sign no it was here it
was<00:29:15.360><c> awesome</c><00:29:15.600><c> but</c><00:29:15.900><c> but</c><00:29:16.400><c> it's</c><00:29:17.400><c> a</c><00:29:17.580><c> documentary</c>

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%

about that piece too that Kevin made and
 

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.070 align:start position:0%
about that piece too that Kevin made and
we<00:29:22.260><c> like</c><00:29:22.380><c> helped</c><00:29:22.740><c> realize</c><00:29:23.100><c> together</c><00:29:23.480><c> was</c><00:29:24.480><c> that</c>

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.080 align:start position:0%

00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
there was one panel on the studio sick
 

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.030 align:start position:0%
there was one panel on the studio sick

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:29.880 align:start position:0%

00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
this main space right so it's like we
 

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.790 align:start position:0%
this main space right so it's like we

you could kind of pick and choose yeah
 

00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:55.069 align:start position:0%
